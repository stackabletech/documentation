  # The symbolic name of the latest stable version, and how to redirect from/to it.
  # with 'redirect:to', the _actual_ version link is a redirect, and the _actual_ link 
  # contains the symbolic name, i.e. stable.
  # As the user browses the latest docs, there will be 'stable' in the links. Also 
  # search engines will see the 'stable' link and index those pages, so if we release
  # a new version, these links will be already in the index, which is good.
  # Linking to the latest version by version number is still possible, and after the
  # latest version is not latest anymore, the redirect is instead the actual URL.

  latest_version_segment_strategy: redirect:to
  # We deploy our site on netlify, so we use their redirect config mechanism
