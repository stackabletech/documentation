= Stackable Documentation
:base-repo: https://github.com/stackabletech

This is the main repository for the documentation of the Stackable platform.
It uses https://antora.org[Antora].

This repository hosts the Antora playbook file as well as some generic documentation modules.

To build the site install Antora and run:

    antora antora-playbook.yml

WARNING: Due to a https://gitlab.com/antora/antora/-/issues/745[bug] this will _not_ currently work in Node 16. I recommend using the latest LTS release (14) until the issue is resolved.

== Development

During development, it can be helpful to change the playbook so that the source does point at the local directory instead of the remote git repository:

[source,yaml]
----
content:
  sources:
  - url: ./
    branches: main
----

The design & layout comes from our https://github.com/stackabletech/documentation-ui[UI repository].
