= Troubleshooting Antora build errors

* Netlify build error: `Duplicate nav in nightly@home: modules/ROOT/nav.adoc`
** This probably means that there are two branches of the same repository defined in the Antora playbook, that have the same version set.
   They both supply a `nav.adoc` file for the same component and version, and Antora doesn't know which one to pick.
   Make sure that the release branches have the correct version set in their `antora.yml` files and also make sure that the `main` branch is still set to `nightly`.
