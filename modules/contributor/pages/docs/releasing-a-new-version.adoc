= Releasing a new documentation version

NOTE: This guide is directed at internal contributors, as an external contributor, you cannot release a new documentation version.

Whenever there is a new Stackable Data Platform release, the documentation is also released with a new version.
This process has been automated with scripts, which are found in the https://github.com/stackabletech/documentation/tree/main/scripts[`scripts`] directory of the documentation repository.

The process consists of two steps: 

. Making a new release branch (`make-release-branch.sh`)
. Publishing the new version by modifying the playbooks (`publish-new-version.sh`)

Consult the scripts for details about the required steps, as well as prerequisites.
