== Development Environment

In order to contribute source code, you need an environment that is capable of running the following tools:

* https://git-scm.com/[Git{external-link-icon}^]
* https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html[make{external-link-icon}^]
* https://www.docker.com/[Docker{external-link-icon}^]
* https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/[Kind{external-link-icon}^]
* https://helm.sh/[Helm{external-link-icon}^]
* https://kuttl.dev/[Kuttl{external-link-icon}^]
* https://www.rust-lang.org/[Rust{external-link-icon}^]
* https://www.python.org/[Python{external-link-icon}^]
* https://jqlang.github.io/jq/[jq{external-link-icon}^]
* https://github.com/mikefarah/yq[yq{external-link-icon}^]
* https://tilt.dev/[Tilt{external-link-icon}^]
* https://pre-commit.com/[pre-commit{external-link-icon}^] (optional)

Depending on the repository, you might also need https://go.dev/[Go{external-link-icon}^], https://www.java.com/en/[Java{external-link-icon}^] or other programming language support.

Almost all build scripts assume a Unix based environment (preferably Linux).

=== IDEs and Editors

Of course you are free to use whatever works for you best. No editor is perfect but we have positive experience with:

* https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/[IntelliJ Idea{external-link-icon}^] with the `Rust` plug-in
* https://code.visualstudio.com/[VisualStudio Code{external-link-icon}^] with the `rust-analyzer` extension

For `VisualStudio Code` we also recommend the following extensions:

* https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tamasfe.even-better-toml[Even Better TOML{external-link-icon}^]
* https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vadimcn.vscode-lldb[CodeLLDB{external-link-icon}^] (for debugging)
* https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=usernamehw.errorlens[Error Lens{external-link-icon}^] (inline error messages)
* https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=asciidoctor.asciidoctor-vscode[AsciiDoc{external-link-icon}^]
* https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github[GitHub Pull requests and Issues{external-link-icon}^]
* https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens[GitLens{external-link-icon}^]

== Steps

. Make your desired changes in the according repository and test them manually. Ensure that the code compiles without
  warnings (`cargo clippy --all-targets`) and that the code is formatted with `cargo fmt`. Also make sure that all
  changes are made in accordance to the xref:code-style-guide.adoc[source code style guide].
. If code was added or adapted then please create or adapt the unit tests in the same file as well as the integration
  tests in the `tests` directory. Ensure that all unit tests run successfully `cargo test`) and all integration tests
  run successfully (`./scripts/run-tests`). See also <<_changes_in_the_integration_tests>>.
. Comment your code and check with `cargo doc --document-private-items` that there are no syntax errors.
. The YAML schemas of the custom resource definitions (CRDs) are rebuilt when the project is compiled (see
  `rust/operator-binary/build.rs` if changing an operator). These CRDs as well as the product configuration are also
  required in the Helm chart and the Kubernetes manifest. To ensure that everything is in a consistent state, please
  execute `make regenerate-charts`.
. If it is useful for the users of the project to know about the change then it must be added to the changelog. For
  instance, if only the dependencies in an operator are upgraded but nothing changes for the user then the upgrade
  should not be added to the changelog. Conversely, if the dependencies in the {operator-repo}[operator framework{external-link-icon}^] are
  upgraded then changes are probably required in the operators (which are the clients of the framework) and therefore
  the upgrade must be mentioned in the changelog. The changelog must be formatted according to
  https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/[keep a changelog{external-link-icon}^].

== Changes in the integration tests

. Most code changes should also be tested with integration tests. The tests for every operator can be found in the
  operator repository in the `tests` directory.
. Create or adapt the tests.
  Try to mimic the style of the other tests.
  They are written with https://kuttl.dev/[KUTTL{external-link-icon}^] and our own templating tool https://github.com/stackabletech/beku.py[beku.py{external-link-icon}^] to template tests and test multiple product versions at once.
. Start a test cluster using https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/[kind{external-link-icon}^].
. Run your development version of the operator with `make run-dev` (see also xref:testing-on-kubernetes.adoc[] for more information on this).
  This will deploy the operator directly into the cluster, also using part of the Helm Chart definition and therefore the RBAC rules.
. When making changes to the Helm Chart, you should however test the Helm Chart explicitly.
  First a Docker image of the operator must be built locally and uploaded to the kind cluster and then the Helm chart must be installed.
  This can be achieved in the operator directory with the following commands:
+
[source,bash]
----
docker build --file docker/Dockerfile --tag oci.stackable.tech/sdp/<operator>:<version>-dev .
kind load docker-image oci.stackable.tech/sdp/<operator>:<version>-dev --name=integration-tests
helm install <operator> deploy/helm/<operator>/
----
. Run the tests from the repository root with `./scripts/run-tests`.

== Adding support for a new product version

If a new version of a product was added then the following tasks must be performed:

* Add the new version in the https://github.com/stackabletech/docker-images[docker-images{external-link-icon}^] repository.
* Update the operator to support the new version if necessary.
* Update the examples in the operator to use the new version.
* Update the integration tests.
  The tests should cover the latest patch version of each supported versions.
* Add the new version to the supported ones in the documentation of the operators (see
  `docs/modules/\{product name\}/partials/supported-versions.adoc` in the operator repositories).
