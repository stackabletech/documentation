# Documentation style guide

// make this document a whole "How to contribute documentation" (?)
// just a style guide?
// should we document also stuff about the structure?
// what about graphics?

// graphics and a whole "How to contribute docs" is not in the scope
// probably not to be done for now (even though it would be nice to have)
// it sucks a bit to have the style guide a bit in a vacuum, but I think for now it would be fine. I could make a ticket for writing "How to contribute docs"

This page provides guidelines on how to write documentation for the Stackable platform. Style guidelines are provided specifying things such as capitalization rules, which format to use for emphasis or how API objects and other components should be styled in the documentation - formatting and "superficial" aspects of text. There are also guidelines on grammar, tone and voice, making the texts across the documentation consistent and as clear as possible; for example using a conversational tone, using second person and using active voice.

For specific formatting, we follow the link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/contribute/style/style-guide/[Kubernetes documentation style guide]. The Stackable platform is built on Kubernetes and the documentation often refers to Kubernetes API objects, custom resources and snippets of resource specifications, as well as command line snippets to interact with Kubernetes clusters. How to format these in the documentation is covered in the Kubernetes documentation style guide.

For general formatting, language, grammar and tone guidelines we refer to the link:https://developers.google.com/style/[Google developer documentation style guide]. Some highlights:

- link:https://developers.google.com/style/tone[Be conversational and friendly]
- link:https://developers.google.com/style/person[Use second person]: "You" rather than "we"
- link:https://developers.google.com/style/voice[Use active voice]
- link:https://developers.google.com/style/capitalization[Use sentence case for headings]

The Google guide also includes it's own list of link:https://developers.google.com/style/highlights[highlights].

Lastly, these are guidelines and not strict rules to follow. Use your own judgement to clearly communicate and explain - after all this is what documentation is about.
