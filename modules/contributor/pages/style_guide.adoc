# Documentation style guide

// make this document a whole "How to contribute documentation" (?)
// just a style guide?
// should we document also stuff about the structure?
// what about graphics?

// graphics and a whole "How to contribute docs" is not in the scope
// probably not to be done for now (even though it would be nice to have)
// it sucks a bit to have the style guide a bit in a vacuum, but I think for now it would be fine. I could make a ticket for writing "How to contribute docs"

For consistency and clarity, we provide some guidelines on how to write documentation.
