|===

There are a few other important repositories that come up frequently:

|===
|Name |GitHub repository |Description

|operator-rs
|https://github.com/stackabletech/operator-rs
|A Rust library with common functionality for our operators

|Secret Operator
|https://github.com/stackabletech/secret-operator
|Manages/generates Kubernetes secrets, and mounts them into pods using CSI

|Listener Operator
|https://github.com/stackabletech/listener-operator
|A CSI provider intended to provide an abstract way to expose a single Pod to the outside network, while hiding details about the cluster from the application developer.

|Issues
|https://github.com/stackabletech/issues
|This repository exists solely for the purpose of tracking issues related to the Stackable Platform in general. Large topics that impact many or even all of the platform components are discussed here. There is no code in this repository.

|Documentation
|https://github.com/stackabletech/documentation
|Platform wide documentation, such as this page, are hosted here.
This repository has references to documentation that is hosted in individual operator repositories (see above).
It is the main source from which the public https://docs.stackable.tech/[Documentation] page is generated.
The documentation is written in https://asciidoctor.org[AsciiDoc] format and processed with https://antora.org[Antora]

|Docker Images
|https://github.com/stackabletech/docker-images
|The Stackable Platform can be used to install and run up several open-source products such as https://kafka.apache.org[Apache Kafka] or https://trino.io[Trino].
Container images of these products hosted on the https://repo.stackable.tech/[Stackable Repository Manager] and the sources hosted in this repository.

NOTE: Operators host their ``Dockerfile``s in their own repository.

|Integration Tests
|https://github.com/stackabletech/integration-tests
|The Stackable Operators are tested in many environments and across cloud providers.
Integration tests are currently driven by `Kuttl` and are hosted here.

|T2
|https://github.com/stackabletech/t2
|Integration testing across different versions and cloud providers is being developed here.

|Operator Templating
|https://github.com/stackabletech/operator-templating/
|Stackable develops and maintains a growing number of operators for open source software.

The high level structure of the repository is consistent across all repositories, which in the past has led to repetitive maintenance tasks in many repositories even for small changes.

This repository is intended to help with these changes by keeping common files as templates and offering tooling to roll these out to all repositories that are under management by this tool.
