The documentation is written in https://asciidoctor.org[AsciiDoc] format and processed with https://antora.org[Antora]

Almost all build scripts assume a Unix based environment (preferably Linux).


. The Stackable Platform documentation can be found at https://docs.stackable.tech/. The documentation is built with
  Antora from the sources in the {docs-repo}[documentation repository] and the `docs` directories in the operator
  repositories. Follow the steps in <<Preparation>> to be able to change the documentation.
. Make your changes.
. Build the documentation locally to ensure that the formatting is fine and all links are specified correctly. See the
  {docs-readme}[`README.adoc`] file for further details and the xref:docs-style-guide.adoc[] for style and formatting
  guidelines.
