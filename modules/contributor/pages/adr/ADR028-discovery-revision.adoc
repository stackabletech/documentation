== Context and Problem Statement

// Describe the context and problem statement, e.g., in free form using two to three sentences. You may want to
// articulate the problem in form of a question.

This ADR is written with specific problems in mind, but the goal is to reach a generic mechanism for the discovery of
products. The current discovery mechanism is described
https://docs.stackable.tech/home/stable/concepts/service_discovery.html[in our docs] (make sure to pick the 23.1
version).

Basically when clients connect to products managed by Stackable, they need to have certain information about how to
connect to these products. Currently we expose some of these information, but not all (e.g. which ca cert the exposed
product uses). On the other hand it could be the case that users have external services which Stackable services should
use, e.g. an non-stackable HDFS where an Stackable Trino should connect to.

*Question 1:* How do we want to make products discoverable?
*Question 2:* How should clients verify the identity of the server (e.g. the cert of the server)
*Question 3:* How should clients authenticate themselves against the server?

== Decision Drivers

We have some common use-cases that we need to express via the discovery mechanism:

1. Trino cluster
* Currently we don't write any discovery CM
* We need at least
** Coordinator address (currently only single coordinator is supported)
*** Ideally split it into the following attributes, so that clients can construct the URI. (trino python client e.g.
    needs all of these attributes separately and I don't want to rely on parsing and extracting the URI)
**** protocol (http/https)
**** host
**** port
*** In case of https: The SecretClass that provided the cert for the *server*
** What AuthenticationClass must be used to authenticate
*** null (no SecretClass): Means no authentication at all
*** static: One of these plain credentials
*** tls: provides ca.crt that needs to have signed the *client* certificate
*** ldap: <whatever>
*** (future) kerberos: kdc where you can get a ticket from (together with the realm)
*** (future) oauth/oidc: <whatever>
*** (future) jwt: <whatever>

2. HDFS cluster
* Currently we expose hdfs-site and core-site
* We need at least
** hdfs-site
** core-site
** What AuthenticationClass must be used to authenticate
*** kerberos: kdc where you can get a ticket from (together with the realm)
** The information about rpc encryption is already in the core-site, so no need to expose it explicitly
** The information about data encryption is already in the hdfs-site, so no need to expose it explicitly

== Considered Options

=== Discovery Object

This Discovery Object is written by the Product Operator. It describes how the product can be accessed by other
connecting entities (clients). These clients can be inside the same Kubernetes cluster, in an external Kubernetes
cluster or deployed using a different approach like running inside a VM or on bare metal hardware. The discovery object
is used both internally by the SDP and by other actors (for example users). Each Discovery Object is created in the same
namespace the product runs in. This means cross-namespace discovery needs special attention.

==== Discovery Object: Option 1 - ConfigMap

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: simple-hdfs
spec:
  data:
    hdfs-site.xml:
    core-site.xml:
    ca.crt: | # Containing a PEM certificate
      === BEGIN CERTIFICATE ===
      XXX
      === END CERTIFICATE ===
    authentication: |
      kerberos:
        secretClass: client-tls # Use this SecretClass to obtain a keytab
    # Alternative solution without yaml enum:
    authenticationType: Kerberos
    authenticationSecretClass: client-kerberos
----

===== Pros

* Easier to use for consuming applications outside of Stackable, as they can simply mount the CM or download it to a
  file. On the other hand when we start to put in yaml objects that need to be parsed we would loose the benefit.
* Single API call to retrieve all running products

===== Cons

* No complex structure such as enums (we can mitigate this by sticking in custom yaml into the CM). Users don't have any
  form of validation when creating their own discovery CM e.g. pointing to their existing HDFS.
* Cannot have two products with the same name, as the discovery CM name clashes. One solution could be to prefix the
  product name (e.g. trino-simple), This can impose other problems such as too long CM names.

==== Discovery Object: Option 2 - Dedicated CRD Object for every Product

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: hdfs.stackable.tech/v1alpha1
kind: HdfsClusterDiscovery
metadata:
  name: simple-hdfs
spec:
  hdfs-site.xml: # xml
  core-site.xml: # xml
  httpProtocol:
    http: {}
    # OR
    https:
      caBundle: | # Containing a PEM certificate
        === BEGIN CERTIFICATE ===
        XXX
        === END CERTIFICATE ===
  authentication:
    kerberos:
      secretClass: client-tls # Use this SecretClass to obtain a keytab
----

===== Pros

* Validation by using e.g. complex enums
* Commons structure can be shared between all operators, such as `Listener` endpoints or tls server certificate
  information

===== Cons

* Operator A needs to compile against operator B to have access to it's discovery struct. An alternative would be to put
  the Discovery CRDs in operator-rs.
* Operator versioning hell. On the other hand we have the same problem with ConfigMaps, as e.g. a newly introduced key
  is missing because of an older hdfs operator version.
* Dependant Pods (such as hbase on hdfs) can not simply mount a CM containing the hdfs-site and core-site. Instead the
  hbase-operator needs to read the HdfsClusterDiscovery, copy the hdfs-site and core-site into a CM and than mount that
  into the hbase Pods. This can be solved by the HdfsClusterDiscovery to point to a CM that contains hdfs-site and
  core-site XML files.
* Multiple API calls need to retrieve all running Stackable service (in stackablectl or cockpit). This would be a single
  API call in case of discovery CM or a shared CRD for all product discoveries.
* Side-Note: `stackablectl stacklet list` should *not* look at discovery objects, as they can come from a user and are
  external systems, where we don't know anything about.

==== Discovery Object: Option 3 - Dedicated CRD Object + ConfigMap for every Product

[source,yaml]
----
# This struct should *not* contain any information than any client possible wants to mount
# Instead put these kind of information into the CM
#
# This struct resides in a new repo stackable-discovery and is pulled in as a dependency in (possibly) operator-rs and all operators.
apiVersion: hdfs.stackable.tech/v1alpha1
kind: HdfsClusterDiscovery
metadata:
  name: simple-hdfs
spec:
  productVersion: 3.3.4 # *could* be put in common struct and #[serde(flattened)]
  hdfsSitesConfigMap: hdfs-simple-hdfs
  httpProtocol:
    http: {}
    # OR
    https:
      caSecretClass: tls
  authentication:
    kerberos:
      keytabSecretClass: client-tls # Use this SecretClass to obtain a keytab
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: hdfs-simple-hdfs # prefix to avoid naming collisions
spec:
  data:
    hdfs-site.xml: <xml>
    core-site.xml: <xml>
----

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: trino.stackable.tech/v1alpha1
kind: TrinoClusterDiscovery
metadata:
  name: simple-trino
spec:
  productVersion: "414"
  coordinatorEndpoint:
    host: trino-coordinator.ns.svc.cluster.local
    port: 8443
    protocol:
      http: {}
      # OR
      https:
        caCertSecretClass: tls
  authentication: <whatever>, see below
# No CM needed
----

===== Pros

* Fixes mount problem from `Discovery Object: Use dedicated CRD object for every product`

===== Cons

==== Discovery Object: Option 4 - Dedicated CRD Object shared between all Products

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: discovery.stackable.tech/v1alpha1
kind: ClusterDiscovery
metadata:
  name: simple-hdfs
spec:
  productVersion: 3.3.4
  hdfs: # same structure as in HdfsClusterDiscovery example
    hdfsSitesConfigMap: hdfs-simple-hdfs
    httpProtocol:
      http: {}
      # OR
      https:
        caSecretClass: tls
    authentication:
      kerberos:
        keytabSecretClass: client-tls # Use this SecretClass to obtain a keytab
  # OR
  hbase: # Whatever
  # OR
  zookeeper: # Whatever
  # ...
----

===== Pros

* Only one struct in operator-rs => No cross-operator dependencies.
* Single API call to retrieve all stackable products. Question is if this really helps a lot, as callers probably also
  are interested in the status of the product, which needs further API calls (irrelevant - see Cons).

===== Cons

* All product discoveries are versioned together. E.g. a new mandatory field for hdfs requires all operators to bump the
  Discovery CRD to `v2`. We hope that this does not happen too often.
* Names can collide
* `stackablectl stacklet list` should *not* look at discovery objects, as they can come from a user and are external
  systems, where we don't know anything about. So in case we want to introduce a `Stacklet` object listing anyway, so
  the `Pro` regarding the API calls is irrelevant.

==== Discovery Object: Option 5 - Write Discovery to Product CR Status

Instead of writing discovery information to dedicated objects - such as CM or custom CR - we "simply" write the
discovery information to the status of the Cluster CR.

===== Pros

* None currently

===== Cons

* It does not enable users to bring their own product and talk to it from Stackable, e.g. a user-provided HDFS.
* It does not allow things such as a ZNode for Zookeeper as we either use the Zookeeper CR for discovery or we use a
  ZNode but than can't use a Zookeeper CR. Currently we have the freedom of either connection to a Zookeeper root dir or
  a ZNode transparently.

=== TLS

==== TLS: Option 1 - Discovery Config contains SecretClass

The discovery includes the SecretClass used to obtain the ca.crt used to validate the *server* certificate.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: trino.stackable.tech/v1alpha1
kind: TrinoClusterDiscovery
metadata:
  name: simple-trino
spec:
  coordinatorEndpoint:
    host: trino-coordinator.ns.svc.cluster.local
    port: 8443
    protocol:
      http: {}
      # OR
      https:
        caCertSecretClass: tls # gives ca.crt used to verify the server cert
---
# superset config
security:
  tls: # server tls cert
    secretClassName: tls
backends: # Don't look at the Superset CRD structure, we are only interested in the tls stuff here
  - name: my-trino
    trino:
      discovery: my-trino
----

===== Pros

* Currently none

===== Cons

* Currently none

==== TLS: Option 2 - Client specifies SecretClass

The discovery does *not* include the SecretClass used to obtain the *server* certificate. Instead the client must
specify which SecretClass should be used to verify the *server* certificate. For usability reasons it can be omitted and
defaults to the SecretClass the client uses for itself.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: trino.stackable.tech/v1alpha1
kind: TrinoClusterDiscovery
metadata:
  name: simple-trino
spec:
  coordinatorEndpoint:
    host: trino-coordinator.ns.svc.cluster.local
    port: 8443
    protocol:
      http: {}
      # OR
      https: {} # NO! cert information
# superset config
security:
  tls:
    secretClassName: tls
backends: # Don't look at the Superset CRD structure, we are only interested in the tls stuff here
  - name: my-trino
    trino:
      discovery: my-trino
      # override tls from the global config, OPTIONALLY
      tlsSecretClass: my-second-pki
----

===== Pros

* Operator does not need to read/look at the DiscoveryConfig (as we can statically set up the secret-op tls secretClass
  volumes rather than retrieving them from the DiscoveryConfig).
* Some clients only support a single pki, in that case we could not give the ability to overwrite the secretClass coming
  from the product itself.

===== Cons

* The client has to know what pki/secretClass the server is using.
* Superset TrinoConnection could not only say "Connect this Superset and this Trino", but need to say "using this ca.crt
  to validate the Trino server"

==== TLS: Option 3 - Include caCert in Discovery Config

[source,yaml]
----
metadata:
  name: my-trino
endpoint:
  host: trino-coordinator.ns.svc.cluster.local
  port: 8443
  protocol:
    http: {}
    # OR
    https:
      caBundle: | # Containing a PEM certificate
        === BEGIN CERTIFICATE ===
        XXX
        === END CERTIFICATE ===
----

===== Pros

* Easier for external clients to use as they don't need to know the concept of SecretClasses and don't even need to run
  withing k8s.
* The client has to *not* know what pki/secretClass the server is using.

===== Cons

* BIG QUESTION: How should the product operator get the CA cert from the SecretClass it uses to get the *server* cert
  from?
** The secret-op could e.g. offer an HTTP api to fetch the ca.crt of a given SecretClass or e.g. write the ca.crt into
   the status of a SecretClass


==== TLS: Option 4 - Include SecretClass in Discovery (User can override it)

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: trino.stackable.tech/v1alpha1
kind: TrinoClusterDiscovery
metadata:
  name: simple-trino
spec:
  coordinatorEndpoint:
    host: trino-coordinator.ns.svc.cluster.local
    port: 8443
    protocol:
      http: {}
      # OR
      https:
        caCertSecretClass: tls # gives ca.crt used to verify the server cert
---
# superset config
security:
  tls: # server tls cert
    secretClassName: tls
backends: # Don't look at the Superset CRD structure, we are only interested in the tls stuff here
  - name: my-trino
    trino:
      discovery: my-trino
      # OPTIONALLY override the spec.coordinatorEndpoint.protocol.https.caCertSecretClass coming from TrinoClusterDiscovery
      tlsSecretClass: my-second-pki
----

===== Pros

* Compromise with all usability and flexibility

===== Cons

* Less secure by default

'''

=== Authentication

==== Authentication: Option 1 - Add AuthenticationClass to Discovery Config

[source,yaml]
----
metadata:
  name: my-trino
authentication:
  authenticationClass: my-class
----

===== Pros

* IMPORTANT: This is the only thing the server can know (how he is verifying client identities). He can not recommend an
  SecretClass used to obtain the client credentials. E.g. he uses an LDAP AuthenticationClass, there is no way it can
  now what SecretClass provides credentials accepted by LDAP. (Most cases it will be a user logging into a WebUI and the
  LDAP credentials of the user are not even stored anywhere but just remembered by the user)

===== Cons

* Operator has to read the AuthenticationClass to determine its type (pw/tls/keytab) and set up the needed volumes and
  commands.
// * The AuthenticationClass is meant to describe "how should a server verify connecting clients" and re-purpose it to 
//   mean "how a client should authenticate itself". Image a user creates a Secret `trino-users` with *only* a ca.crt
//   and a SecretClass `trino-users` on top. The connecting client than has no way of knowing how to get a client cert.

==== Authentication: Option 2 - Add SecretClass to Discovery Config

[source,yaml]
----
metadata:
  name: my-trino
authentication:
  secretClass: client-tls # Use this SecretClass to obtain your credentials (regardless of type of SecretClass)
----

===== Pros

* Currently none

===== Cons

* Operator has to read the SecretClass to determine its type (pw/tls/keytab) and set up the needed volumes and commands.
* Image then SecretClass is of type `k8sSearch`. The connection client (e.g. controlled via superset-operator) than has
  no idea if he should expect a tls.crd or a keytab when mounting the SecretClass.

==== Authentication: Option 3 - Add needed Details

Trino discovery:
[source,yaml]
----
metadata:
  name: my-trino
authentication:
  none: {}
  password: {}
  tls:
    secretClass: client-tls # Use this SecretClass to obtain a *client* cert tls.crt
  kerberos:
    secretClass: client-kerberos # Use this SecretClass to obtain a keytab
----

===== Pros

* Operator has *not* to read the SecretClass to determine its type (pw/tls/keytab), as the type is already encoded in
  the Discovery config.

===== Cons

* Currently none

==== Authentication: Option 4 - Provide no Authentication Information

Trino discovery does not provide any information on how to authenticate

===== Pros

* Currently none

===== Cons

* Not viable, as users need to know how to connect, and are not expected to try 50 different auth methods. We need to
  give them a AuthenticationClass, that says them e.g. what LDAP or PKI is used.

== Decision Outcome

* *Discovery Object:* Option 3
* *Server TLS:* TBD, but leaning towards Option 2
* *Authentication:* Option 1

=== Appendix A

Let's model a kerberos secured HDFS with the Options "TLS: Include caCert in Discovery config" and "Authentication:
Add needed details"
