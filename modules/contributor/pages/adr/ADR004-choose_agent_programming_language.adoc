== Context and Problem Statement

Which programming language should be used in the implementation of the agent that will manage tool installations on servers?

== Decision Drivers

* The ability to deploy the agent as one binary with no external dependencies
* Availability of well supported libraries for necessary operations
** File IO
** Network IO
** systemd
* IDE support
* Debugging options

== Considered Options

* Java
* Go
* Rust

== Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Rust", because it came out best (see below)].

=== Positive Consequences

Rust is a Programming language
* focused on safety and
* provides memory safety without a garbage collector.

=== Negative Consequences

Rust is a Programming language
* with a steep learning curve.

== Pros and Cons of the Options

=== Java

* Good, because easy to find developers
* Good, because team is very familiar with it
* Bad, because it needs a jvm as dependency and is not deployable as single binary
** GraalVM has many drawbacks and licensing doubts as it is an Oracle product

=== Go

* Good, because it compiles to a single binary on many platforms
* Good, because Kubernetes also uses it
* Good, because there is proper IDE support with debugging
* Bad, because a new language to learn for many team members
* Bad, because missing generics may be an issue and create less than readable code
* Bad, because it is still a garbage collected language

=== Rust

* Good, because it compiles to a single binary on many platforms
* Good, because no garbage collection
* Good, because it enforces a high level of security
* Bad, because a new language to learn for many team members
* Bad, because potentially very touch to find developers - arguably not a real drawback as people will need to be willing to learn something new anyway
