== Context and Problem Statement
Currently users have to specify the full image tag in the Products CRD, as described in xref:adr/ADR018-product_image_versioning.adoc[].

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  version: 1.4.1-stackable2.1.0
----

This must be a tag belonging to an image from the stackable repository. In order to give the user the opportunity to provide a own repository, mirror our repository or provide a complete own image, we'd like to propose a solution for it.

== Decision Drivers

* Flexible and extendable solution for possible use cases
* Preserve the possibility of magic version completion of operators for images (e.g. `superset:1.4.1` => `superset:1.4.1-stackable2.1.0`)
* Allow the user to easily paste in a complete image name
* Allow users to use some defaults, allow them to only override certain things

In detail we used the following use-cases to drive the decision:

* use Stackable repo
** users specified version 1.4.1-stackable2.1.0
=> operator should use image docker.stackable.tech/stackable/superset:1.4.1-stackable2.1.0
** users specified version 1.4.1
=> operator should use image docker.stackable.tech/stackable/superset:1.4.1-stackable2.1.0 based on compatibility knowledge (which operator works with which image)
** users specifies no version
=> operator should use image docker.stackable.tech/stackable/superset:1.4.1-stackable2.1.0 based on recommended product version of the release/operator and knowledge (which operator works with which image)

* use self-hosted (mirrored) repo
** users specified version 1.4.1-stackable2.1.0 and imageRepository my.corp/superset
=> operator should use image my.corp/superset:1.4.1-stackable2.1.0 based on imageRepository
=> Equivalent to user saying use the image "my.corp/superset:1.4.1-stackable2.1.0"
** users specified version 1.4.1 and imageRepository my.corp/superset
=> operator should use image my.corp/superset:1.4.1-stackable2.1.0 based on imageRepository and compatibility knowledge (which operator works with which image)
=> Equivalent to user saying use the image "my.corp/superset:1.4.1-stackable2.1.0"
=> NOT equivalent to user saying use the image "my.corp/superset:1.4.1"
=> When specifying the image directly users loose the ability to let the operator determine its compatible stackable image version
** user just specifies a repo: my.corp/superset with no versions -> operator should use image my.corp/superset:1.4.1-stackable2.1.0 based on recommended product version of the release/operator and knowledge (which operator works with which image)


== Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "<<option6,Option 6>>" because it is the only option to cover all use cases.

== Pros and Cons of the Options

=== Option 1
[source,yaml]
----
version: 1.4.1-stackable2.1.0 # optional (currently operator will error out but in the future according to ADR 18 operator should pick a good version automatically)
imageRepository: docker.stackable.tech/stackable/superset # Option<String>
----

* Good, because it's non-breaking
* Good, because users can specify `version: 1.4.1` and the operator will resolve it to `1.4.1-stackable2.1.0` (or whatever stackable versions works for *him*). This mechanism continues working. For this to work the customers needs to mirror the exact same tags as we at Stackable have (he can't rename the tags).

=== Option 2
[source,yaml]
----
version: 1.4.1-stackable2.1.0 # optional (currently operator will error out but in the future according to ADR 18 operator should pick a good version automatically)
image: docker.stackable.tech/stackable/superset:1.4.1-stackable2.1.0 # Option<String>. Will overwrite version (if specified)
----

* Good, because it's non-breaking because mechanism from Option 1 is not implemented yet
* Bad, because mechanism explain in Option 1 breaks.

=== Option 3
[source,yaml]
----
image:
  version: 1.4.1-stackable2.1.0 # optional (currently operator will error out but in the future according to ADR 18 operator should pick a good version automatically)
  imageRepository: docker.stackable.tech/stackable/superset # Option<String>
----

* Bad, because it's breaking
* Bad, because versions can only contain the product version (e.g. `1.4.1`). Having this "hidden" under image may seem like an implementation detail to the user. It can be argued that version is important enough to be a top-level field.

=== Option 4
[source,yaml]
----
version: 1.4.1-stackable2.1.0 # optional (currently operator will error out but in the future according to ADR 18 operator should pick a good version automatically)
imageOverwrite: # Option<struct>
  repository: docker.stackable.tech/stackable/superset # String
  tag: 1.4.1-stackable2.1.0 # Option<String>. Will overwrite tag (the specified version is ignored/overwritten)
----

* Good, because it's non-breaking
* Good, because when only `imageOverwrite.repository` is specified, it's the same as option 1 with all the benefits
* Good, because when `imageOverwrite.repository` and `imageOverwrite.tag` is specified, it's the same as option 2 with all the benefits

[[option5]]
=== Option 5
[source,yaml]
----
image: # mandatory complex enum
  stackableImageTag: 1.4.1-stackable2.1.0 # String
  # OR
  custom: docker.stackable.tech/stackable/superset:1.4.1-stackable2.1.0 # String
  # OR (later on)
  stackableVersion: 1.4.1 # String
  # OR (later on)
  recommendedVersion: true # needs to be set to true. if set to false operator will error out
----

We want to start with the first two variants `stackableImageTag` and `custom`. The `magicVersionResolving` and `recommendedVersion` variants _might_ be added later on.

* Bad, because it's breaking
* Good, because it gives all flexibility of all previous options
* Good, because we can non-breaking introduce new "magic" in the future by adding new image enum variants
* Good, because we can implement it as enum called e.g. `ImageSpec` in operator-rs which will offer a function like `resolve_image` that will make it easy for operators to use

[[option6]]
=== Option 6

This option is **breaking**. It uses a complex enum, similar to Option 5. Option 5 does not account for the need to specify the product version with a custom image. It is also not possible to just use a custom docker repository and still use the operator recommended version (i.e. just mirroring the stackable repository). This option makes that possible. We first start with implementing `stackableVersion` and `custom`. The `stackable` enum variant will be implemented as soon as we have the magic stackableVersion resolution.

[source,yaml]
----
image: # complex enum
  stackableVersion: # (1)
    repo: docker.stackable.tech # String. Defaults to docker.stackable.tech (kind of optional).
    productVersion: 1.4.1 # mandatory
    stackableVersion: stackable2.1.0 # mandatory
  # OR
  stackable: # (2)
    repo: docker.stackable.tech # String. Defaults to docker.stackable.tech (kind of optional).
    productVersion: 1.4.1 # Option<String>. If not specified use recommended product version ("magic").
  # OR
  custom: # (3)
    productVersion: 1.4.1
    custom: docker.stackable.tech/stackable/superset:1.4.1-stackable2.1

  pullPolicy: IfNotPresent
  pullSecrets: # Option<Vec<LocalObjectReference>>
    name: regcred # reference to secret in same namespace
----

**Known issues**: We will start to implement our own schema since kube-rs is not supporting flatten yet.

**Use-case**: I don't want to specify anything, just give me defaults!

-> Don't specify anything.

**Use-case**: I want a specific version of the product:

[source,yaml]
----
image:
  productVersion: 1.5.1
----

This resolves to the enum variant 2, with just the product version specified

**Use-case**: I've mirrored the stackable repo locally, but want to use automatic image resolution:

[source,yaml]
----
image:
  repo: my.repo.company.org/stackable
----

This resolves to variant 2.

**Use-case**: I have built my own custom image with i.e. additional dependencies for the product, which has a different tag than the original stackable image. I've uploaded it to my custom repo:

[source,yaml]
----
image:
  custom: my.repo.company.org/stackable/superset:my-custom-tag
  productVersion: 1.4.1
----

This resolves to enum variant 3. The product version is mandatory so the operator knows what to do.
