== Context and Problem Statement

Should we use one large repository for all components of the project or structure this into multiple smaller repositories?

== Decision Drivers

* Useability of repository structure
* Impact on related infrastructure like CI / Testing / ...
* Impact on release strategy

== Considered Options

* Single Repository
* Multiple Repositories

== Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Multiple Repositories", because it comes out best (see below)].

How to split the components into repositories will be decided throughout the runtime of the project.

Initially the following repositories were identified:

* Orchestrator
* Agent
* ADR / Documentation
* Operators (most probably one repository per operator)
* Stackbit Sources (most probably one repository per product)

=== Positive Consequences

* The ability to separate changes to different modules
* Better organization of individual modules
* Better separation of releases between modules

=== Negative Consequences

* No single place to search for things, a little familiarity with the repository structure might be needed
* Potentially more effort when setting up CI and testing infrastructure

== Pros and Cons of the Options

=== Single Repository

* Good, because it makes implementing dependencies between modules easier
* Good, because it provides a single place to search for _things_
* Bad, because it can become large and difficult to manage
* Bad, because it keeps things that should be loosely coupled in the same place which might promote tighter coupling
* Bad, because tagging a release of a component will unnecessarily include the rest of the repository
* Bad, because changes to a component may accidentally impact other components
* Bad, because the commit history is mixed for all components
* Bad, because a single commit may change multiple components making tracking these changes harder
* Bad, because the CI pipeline would need to identify the changed components to avoid triggering tests for all other components
* Bad, because clone times might be much higher

=== Multiple Repositories

* Good, because it keeps the individual repositories simpler
* Good, because it allows proper separation of modules
* Good, because it allows proper tagging of releases
* Bad, because implementing dependent changes in separate components becomes harder
* Bad, because it makes finding individual pieces of code potentially harder if the repository is unknown
