== Context and Problem Statement

Monitoring Spark applications usually involves two types of components: a history server and a metrics collection server.
__In this document we will concern ourselves with the history server__. Using metrics for application monitoring requires
a completely different set of protocols and technologies and is outside the scope of this document.

The Spark history server is part of the Apache Spark distribution and it provides a web interface where application
developers can visualize events that took place during the lifetime of a job as well as the outcome of various job phases.

In this document, we propose a way to add the Spark history server to the Kubernetes resources that are managed by the
Spark-on-Kubernetes operator. We also describe how Spark application definitions can leverage the history server and
how the resource definitions make use of standard Stackable descriptors for S3 storage.

Even though using a history server is optional when running Spark applications on the Stackable platform, it is highly
recommended to make use of it in production environments.

== Decision Drivers

* Ease of use / intuitive / checked
* Support multiple history servers per operator installation
* Integrate with the Stackable platform resource handling for S3 storage

== History Server Definition

A history server is a separate entity, completely decoupled from any `SparkApplication`s. The Spark-on-k8s operator makes use of
it only if available and if the Spark application developer has requested it. See the chapter below, on how `SparkApplication`s
can request logging events to an existing history server.

The most important part of the history server definition is the location of the event files. This is specified in the
`logFileDirectory` entry of the resource specification as shown below.

[source,yaml]
----
  ...
  logFileDirectory:
    s3:
      prefix: eventlogs/
      bucket: # S3BucketDef
        bucketName: spark-eventlogs
        connection:
          reference: eventlogs-s3-connection
  ...
----

Here the event files are stored in the S3 bucket `spark-eventlogs` with the `eventlogs/` prefix. The complete definition
of the specified S3 connection is resolved by the operator from the `eventlogs-s3-connection` resource (not shown here).

All Spark history properties can be defined in the `properties` section. The operator will make them available to the
server at runtime. The operator makes no effort to validate these properties so extreme care must be taken making use
of this section. In particular, properties concerning the event file storage can conflict with the definition provided
in the `logFileDirectory` section and it's not recommended to set them here at all.

Here is a complete example of a history server definition:

[source,yaml]
----
# Namespaced
apiVersion: spark.stackable.tech/v1alpha1
kind: SparkHistoryServer
metadata:
  name: history
  namespace: default
spec:
  version: 3.3.0-stackable0.1.0
  sparkConf:
    - # compaction
    - # retention/ttl
    - # update interval
    - ...
  cleaner: true # option of bool; default=false: sets spark.history.fs.cleaner.enabled=true
  # complex enum with variant s3 (hdfs later on)
  logFileDirectory:
    s3:
      prefix: eventlogs/
      bucket: # S3BucketDef
        inline:
          bucketName: spark-eventlogs
          connection:
            inline:
              host: minio
              port: 9000
              accessStyle: Path
              credentials:
                secretClass: history-server-s3-credentials
----

== History Server Usage

Spark applications don't have to use a history server but it's highly recommended to do so in production environments.
The section `eventLogs` of a `SparkApplication` instructs the operator to configure the application such that it can be
monitored using the provided (and existing) history server.

The example below shows the relevant configuration snippet of an application definition:

[source,yaml]
----
---
apiVersion: spark.stackable.tech/v1alpha1
kind: SparkApplication
metadata:
  name: spark
  namespace: default
spec:
  version: "1.0"
  sparkImage: docker.stackable.tech/stackable/spark-k8s:3.3.0-stackable0.1.0
  logFileDirectory:
    s3:
      prefix: eventlogs/
      bucket: # S3BucketDef
        inline:
          bucketName: spark-eventlogs
          connection:
            inline:
              host: minio
              port: 9000
              accessStyle: Path
              credentials:
                secretClass: eventlogs-s3-credentials
  s3Connection: # Optional. Used for normal data operations.
    inline:
      host: minio
      port: 9000
      accessStyle: Path
      credentials:
        secretClass: application-s3-credentials
...
----

In the example above, the application will log its events to the bucket specifed in `logFileDirectory`.
In addition, the application processes data from a S3 bucket configured within the `s3connection` section of the specification.

The operator will read the `s3Connection` and set up the `fs.s3a.aws.credentials.provider` and co (endpoint, accesskey, secretkey, tls, path-style access - basically all attributes of S3Connection) settings.
Afterwards if `logFileDirectory` attribute is set: Set `fs.s3a.bucket.<logFileDirectory-bucket-name(here spark-eventlogs)>.aws.credentials.provider` and co to overwrite endpoint and credentials for the logging bucket. Set `spark.eventLog.enabled` property to `true` and will
construct the `spark.eventLog.dir` from `s3a://<logFileDirectory-bucket-name(here spark-eventlogs)>/<logFileDirectory-prefix(here eventlogs/)>`.

NOTE: the credentials used by the `HistoryServer` *do not* have to be shared with `SparkApplication`s.

=== Advantages

* Fully flexible solution, which allows the logDir to be on a different S3 ednpoint than the data.
* If they are on the same endpojnt, a single S3BucketDef can be shared between HistoryServer and SparkApplication for ease of use.
* HDFS and/or other distributed filesystems can be added non-breaking later on
