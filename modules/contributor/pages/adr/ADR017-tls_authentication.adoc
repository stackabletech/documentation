Technical Story: https://github.com/stackabletech/zookeeper-operator/issues/466

== Context and Problem Statement

Our products use TLS to encrypt network traffic and/or to authenticate themselves and their clients.
We want to define a common way - across all the products - to configure these mechanisms.

== Decision Drivers
* Must support using no TLS usage, TLS only for encryption and TLS for encryption and authentication
* Should fit into out existing authentication concept from xref:adr/ADR014-user_authentication_for_products.adoc[]
* Should be easy to understand and use for the user

== Considered Options

* Handle TLS as special case
* Extend `AuthenticationClass` to support TLS
* Split server-side and client-side authentication into separate config sections

== Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Split server-side and client-side authentication into separate config sections", because separating them allowed us to model the underlying structs the best way.

== Pros and Cons of the Options

=== Handle TLS as special case
We don't support TLS inside `AuthenticationClass`.
We need a new `tlsConfig` attribute on every product CRD.
An implementation could look something like this:

              server:
                caCert:
                    webPki: {}

----

* Good, because simple (no indirection through `AuthenticationClass` object)
* Bad, because TLS is a special case and does not fit in our `AuthenticationClass` mechanism.

=== Extend `AuthenticationClass` to support TLS

We already have a common `AuthenticationClass` structure discussed in xref:adr/ADR014-user_authentication_for_products.adoc[]
This option extends the `AuthenticationClass` so that it also support TLS authentication.

* Good, because TLS is handled via the generic `AuthenticationClass` mechanism.
* Bad, because an `AuthenticationClass` can express: Don't do any authentication at all

----

As a recap:
This is how our products connect to TLS-secured services outside of the Stackable Cluster (e.g. Superset to LDAP).
Mutual verification is not supported this way, as client-side authentication is handled via `AuthenticationClass`.

* Good, because TLS is handled via the generic `AuthenticationClass` mechanism.
* Good, because clients don't need to know/understand `AuthenticationClass` objects. They only read the Discovery `ConfigMap` and the contained SecretClasses.
* Bad, because it's more complicated because of the indirection via `AuthenticationClass`.
* Bad, because the client operator needs to read the Discovery `ConfigMap` rather than simply mounting it into the client product.
* Bad, because doing so external clients (outside of Stackable) must need to take more effort to connect to Stackable services e.g. retrieve ca cert from `SecretClass`.
