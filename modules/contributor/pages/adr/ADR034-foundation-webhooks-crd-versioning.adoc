== Context

We have to start versioning our CRDs properly and move away from `v1alhpa1` to have stable interfaces for customers to rely on. Since we cannot avoid having breaking changes in the future which require a bump in the respective CRD version, we have to supply conversion webhooks that take care of converting older versions to the current storage version.

A conversion webhook is registered in a CRD like this:

[source,yaml]
----
  conversion:
    strategy: Webhook
    webhook:
      conversionReviewVersions: ["v1"]
      clientConfig:
        service:
          namespace: default
          name: example-conversion-webhook-server
          path: /crdconvert
        caBundle: "Ci0tLS0tQk...<base64-encoded PEM bundle>...tLS0K"
----

This ADR is about the location of webhook endpoint / server that the `webhook.clientConfig.service` is referencing.

== Problem Statement

There are several options on how or where to deploy a conversion webhook, e.g. coupled closely with the operator as a controller or completely decoupled via an extra helm deployment.

We need a uniform deployment across all operators to keep implementation and maintenance to a minimum and reuse code wherever possible.
Additionally, webhooks should be enabled / disabled on demand via options like Helm, operator-parameters or CRD flags.

== Decision Drivers

- Do we want this to be HA?
- Do we want this to be deployed decoupled?
- One operator per kubernetes cluster: What if 3 operators deployed watching different namespaces / versions? Should be strongly discouraged!
- How to abstract a common admission/conversion webhook skeleton in operator-rs, that can be implemented in the operators within a few lines of code (excluding the actual conversion code)?
- How to keep maintenance, updating, pipelines or extra images to a minimum?
- Openshift compatibility?
- How to deactivate or not deploy the conversion webhook if not desired by customers? Or how to activate if opt-in?
- Does the webhook have to keep working if e.g. the operator crashes (coupled)?

== Considered Options

[[option1]]
=== Option 1: Deploy within the operator as controller

The operator contains another controller / thread with the webhook server and conversion code.

==== Pros

- No extra bin / main file
- No extra docker image (Openshift certification)
- No extra pipelines for the build process
- Always up to date with the operator, no extra versioning

==== Cons

- Downgrade not possible -> older operators may not know new storage versions
- Operator crash affects webhook, no custom resources can be applied for that time
  -> prevents writes and reads only current versions works
- Updating webhook requires updating the whole operator
- (OpenShift restrictions? Restricted namespaces etc.?)

[[option2]]
=== Option 2: Deploy within the operator as extra container with operator image

The operator deployment contains another container next to the actual operator containing the webhook server and conversion code using the operator docker image.

==== Pros

- No extra pipelines for the build process
- Could be enabled / disabled Helm parameters
- Operator crash does not affect webhook
- Always up to date with the operator, no extra versioning

==== Cons

- Downgrade not possible -> older operators may not know new storage versions
- Overhead due to operator image (not just the lightweight webhook server)
- Updating webhook requires updating the whole operator
- (Extra bin / main file)
- (OpenShift restrictions? Restricted namespaces etc.?)

[[option3]]
=== Option 3: Deploy within the operator as extra container and extra image

The operator deployment contains another container next to the actual operator containing the webhook server and conversion code using its own docker image.

==== Pros

- No overhead due to operator image (just the lightweight webhook server)
- Operator crash does not affect webhook
- Could be enabled / disabled Helm parameters
- Always up to date with the operator, no extra versioning

==== Cons

- Downgrade not possible -> older operators may not know new storage versions
- Updating webhook requires updating the whole operator
- Extra pipelines / images for the build process
- (OpenShift restrictions? Restricted namespaces etc.?)

[[option4]]
=== Option 4: The operator creates a webhook deployment

The operator deploys a webhook deployment similar to how it deploys e.g. StatefulSets.

==== Pros

- Operator crash does not affect webhook
- Could be enabled / disabled via custom resource
- Always up to date with the operator, no extra versioning
- Should not interfere with OpenShift

==== Cons

- Downgrade not possible -> older operators may not know new storage versions
- Updating webhook requires updating the whole operator (bundle)
- Possibly extra image
- Possibly extra pipelines
- Possibly more complex to test

[[option5]]
=== Option 5: The webhook is a deployment via Helm

The operator Helm bundle contains an extra dedicated deployment with the webhook server (in the operator namespace?). One webhook deployment per operator. Same image as operator.

==== Pros

- Operator crash does not affect webhook
- Downgrade possible -> can adept to new CRD storage versions
- Could be enabled / disabled Helm parameters
- The webhook can be updated independently
- No extra pipelines / images

==== Cons

- Helm drawbacks

== Decision Outcome

Chosen <<option5>>, because it provides us with the most flexibility of deployment and utilization of SDP tools like operator-templating. It has the least amount of drawbacks in terms of complexity, maintain- and updatability. A basic module / crate for the webhook skeleton will be implemented in operator-rs and can be reused with operator specific logic for conversion.

=== Research

- Research: Openshift compatibility
- Research: OLM bundles + operator + webhook

=== Positive Consequences

- Operator-templating
- Can be updated independently of the operator if required
- Parallelize processes like creating infrastructure, cert sidecar containers, "conversion" framework in the operators

=== Negative Consequences

- TBD
