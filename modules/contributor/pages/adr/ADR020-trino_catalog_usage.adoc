== Context and Problem Statement

https://trino.io[Trino] allows user to specify multiple catalogs to connect to a variety of different data-sources.
We need to agree on a mechanism to

1. Specifying Trino catalog definitions (xref:adr/ADR019-trino_catalog_definitions.adoc[])
2. Connect a catalog definition to an Trino cluster (this ADR)

== Decision Drivers

* Catalogs must somehow be added to Trino clusters
* Catalogs should be reusable between multiple Trino clusters - e.g. users have two identical Trino clusters - one for adhoc queries, on for scheduled jobs.

== Considered Options

* Catalog references Clusters
* Cluster references Catalogs
* Mapping object between Catalog and Cluster
* Catalog references Cluster
* Mapping via labels and label selectors

== Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Mapping via labels and label selectors", because it's the most flexible solution and delegates implementation details to kubernetes.

== Pros and Cons of the Options
=== Catalog references Clusters

* Good, because if Trino instances in different stages have different catalogs, a Trino Object can be reused over the different stages
* Bad, because if a Trino Cluster has multiple catalogs and you want a similar Trino Cluster you need to modify all catalogs (and maybe restart your first Trino multiple times), not just simply create a new Trino Cluster copy

=== Cluster references Catalogs

* Good, because it's the normal flow that our Product CRDs point to other objects, not the other direction
* Bad, because people adding new catalogs need to be able to modify the `TrinoCluster` object. There may be companies out there where different people operate Trino and manage the catalogs
* Bad, because if Trino instances in different stages have different catalogs a Trino Object can not be reused over the different stages

=== Mapping object between Catalog and Cluster

* Bad, because more complicated for the users
* Bad, because more complicated watches needed

=== Catalog references Cluster
This is the same as <<_catalog_references_clusters>> but instead of a list of Clusters the Catalog only contains a single Cluster.

* Good, because if Trino instances in different stages have different catalogs a Trino Object can be reused over the different stages
* Good compared to <<_catalog_references_clusters>>, because an `TrinoCatalog` is associated with an `TrinoCluster` and the cluster can add additional information to it like the current deployment status
* Bad, because catalogs can not be reused between multiple Trino clusters


=== Mapping via labels and label selectors
This is option <<_mapping_object_between_catalog_and_cluster>> the "kubernetes way".

Every `TrinoCatalog` object provides a set of labels.
The `TrinoCluster` objects provide a LabelSelector which defines which catalogs should be included in the Trino instance.

* Good, because flexible (Trino cluster administrators can add new catalogs and teams can add their needed catalogs to an managed Trino instance)
* Good, because the usage of well-known kubernetes patterns
* Good, because delegates implementation details to kubernetes (e.g. easier watches)
