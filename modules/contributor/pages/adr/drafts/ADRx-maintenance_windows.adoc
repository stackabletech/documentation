== Context and Problem Statement

When operating productive environments with the tools of the SDP, it can often be desirable to avoid restarts or changes unless they have been planned and communicated.

There are a couple of things that could trigger a change that in turn trigger a restart of the applications in the SDP:

- User changes to the definitions (CRDs)
- Operator upgrade that causes different objects to be written for the same definition
- Changes to dependent objects
- ...

In order to enable users to better control when these changes are allowed to affect deployed applications we should add the ability to define maintenance windows

== Decision Drivers <!-- optional -->

* [driver 1, e.g., a force, facing concern, …]

* … <!-- numbers of drivers can vary -->

== Considered Options

* [option 2]
* [option 3]
* … <!-- numbers of options can vary -->

== Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "[option 1]", because [justification. e.g., only option, which meets k.o. criterion decision driver | which resolves force force | … | comes out best (see below)].

=== Positive Consequences <!-- optional -->

* [e.g., improvement of quality attribute satisfaction, follow-up decisions required, …]
