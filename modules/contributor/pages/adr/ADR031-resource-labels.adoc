== Context and Problem Statement

This ADR tries to solve a common issue within the SDP. When `stackablectl` (and in the future our Cockpit) deploys
resources into a Kubernetes cluster, we are currently unable to properly identify them afterwards. Adding a common set
of labels to the resources we deploy will solve this issue. Additionally we will use namespaces to track resources
deployed together. The following use-cases are then possible:

* Use-case 1: Uninstalling a demo and stack
* Use-case 2: Remove/purge all resources deployed by Stackable at once
* Use-case 3: Stacklet dependency tree (Only needed when decide against a discovery operator, see ...)
* Use-case 4: Offer users to provide their own custom labels

== Decision Drivers

We want to introduce these common labels, as there is currently no reliable and correct way to determine which resources
where deployed by one of our management tools. Deciding on a common and structured set of labels will help us to more
easily manage resources deployed by us. This includes reading, listing, changing and deleting those resources. The
addition of labels will resolve several long-standing issues in various repositories.

== Considered Options

Kubernetes reserves all labels and annotations in the `kubernetes.io` and `k8s.io` namespaces. See
https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/labels-annotations-taints/[here] and
https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/#syntax-and-character-set[here].

=== Preamble

One general decision we have to make is if we ant to introduce scopes for our label keys. In this context, scope refers
to one (or more) domain name labels, otherwise known as subdomains. Scopes would allow us to introduce more granular
(and also grouped) labels. On the other side, we need to consider if we need the added granularity based on the number
and kind of labels we want to add. In general there are two options:

- `<scope>.stackable.tech/<key>=<value>`, with scope being **one** subdomain
- `stackable.tech/<key>=<value>`, no scope

=== Labeling all Resources with a Vendor Label

* `app.kubernetes.io/vendor=Stackable`: This is no official well-known label and also violates the reserved namespaces
  above
* `stackable.tech/vendor=Stackable`: Custom label key prefix, duplicate data
* `meta.stackable.tech/vendor=Stackable`: Alternative to above, scoped, still duplicated data

It's hard (or impossible) to use a label without any duplicated data. So `stackable.tech/vendor=Stackable` seems like
a straight-forward and concise option.

A deployed ConfigMap could look like this:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: superset-node-default
labels:
  app.kubernetes.io/name: superset # reduced set of common labels
  stackable.tech/vendor: Stackable # new vendor label
data:
----

[#ns-labels]
=== Labeling Resources deployed within a Demo or Stack

* `stackable.tech/stack=<stack-name>`: Attached to all resources deployed by `stackablectl stack install`
* `stackable.tech/demo=<demo-name>`: Attached to all resources deployed by `stackablectl demo install`

Alternatives to above are:

* `resources.stackable.tech/<stack|demo>=<stack-name|demo-name>`
* `meta.stackable.tech/<stack|demo>=<stack-name|demo-name>`
* `res.stackable.tech/<stack|demo>=<stack-name|demo-name>`

Both `<stack-name>` and `<demo-name>` will be replaced by the selected stack or demo name. We need to make sure that
this value doesn't exceed the maximum length of 63 characters. If the name is too long, we have three options:

* Hard error out, the installation is canceled (Not recommended because stack and demo names are chosen by us)
* We automatically truncate the name to the maximum length: `a-way-too-long-name` becomes `a-way-too-lo<EOL>`
* We automatically truncate the name and add a random suffix: `a-way-too-long-name` becomes `a-way-a1b2c3<EOL>`

'''

A deployed ConfigMap (by running `stackablectl demo install`) could look like this. Notice that resources part of a demo
**and** a stack include labels for both of these scopes.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: superset-node-default
labels:
  app.kubernetes.io/name: superset # reduced set of common labels
  stackable.tech/vendor: Stackable
  stackable.tech/stack: nifi-kafka-druid-superset-s3 # new stack label
  stackable.tech/demo: nifi-kafka-druid-water-level-data # new demo label
data:
----

=== Namespacing Stacks and Demos

Considered default values for above labels are:

* `stackable-<demo|stack>-<demo-name|stack-name>(-suffix)`: Clearly indicates this namespace belongs to the SDP, we
  might run into length limits
* `<demo|stack>-<demo-name|stack-name>(-suffix)`: Less likely we will run into length limits, but we loose the clear
  indication this namespace belongs to the SDP.

We need to perform length and character validation for these namespace names. There are two possible paths:

* If the user *doesn't* provide a custom namespace, we need to make sure that the value doesn't exceed it's maximum
  length when the stack or demo names are inserted. Truncate the name if needed.
* If the user *does* provide a custom namespace, we need to make sure that the custom namespace length doesn't exceed
  it's maximum length. Don't automatically truncate, instead return an error explaining the user needs to shorten the
  namespace name.

The maximum length for both cases is 63 characters.

=== Adding Label to indicate which Management Tool was used

The following options are available:

* `app.kubernetes.io/managed-by=stackablectl|stackable-cockpit`: Well-known label, however not recommended because Helm
  already uses this label to track which resources are managed by Helm. As we use Helm in the background to install some
  of our manifests, we would potentially break Helms (uninstall) behavior.
* `stackable.tech/managed-by=stackablectl|stackable-cockpit`: Doesn't collide with Helm
* `stackable.tech/deployed-by=stackablectl|stackable-cockpit`: Alternative to above

Alternatives are:

* `management.stackable.tech/managed-by=stackablectl|stackable-cockpit`
* `tools.stackable.tech/managed-by=stackablectl|stackable-cockpit`
* `mgmt.stackable.tech/managed-by=stackablectl|stackable-cockpit`

A deployed ConfigMap could look like this.:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: superset-node-default
labels:
  app.kubernetes.io/name: superset # reduced set of common labels
  stackable.tech/vendor: Stackable
  stackable.tech/managed-by: stackablectl # new management tool label

=== Enabling Custom Labels provided by Users

When providing support for user-controlled custom labels, we need to think about the degree of freedom we want to
support. Possible levels where custom labels could be attached are: cluster, role, and role group level. We also need
to make sure the custom user-provided labels don't collide with our labels. We can either:

* print out a warning and don't apply the invalid label(s)
* hard-error and bail

==== Option 1 - Cluster Level Labels

[source,yaml]
----
---
apiVersion: example.stackable.tech/v1alpha1
kind: ExampleCluster
metadata:
  name: example
spec:
  clusterConfig:
    labels:
      foo: bar
      baz: foo
----

==== Option 2 - Role (and Role Group) Level Labels

[source,yaml]
----
---
apiVersion: example.stackable.tech/v1alpha1
kind: ExampleCluster
metadata:
  name: example
  labels:
    foo: bar
    baz: foo
spec:
----

==== Option 3 - Only Role Level Labels

This option is highly dependant on the outcome of the PodDisruptionBudget ADR. This options requires the introduction
of `roleGroup` discussed in the mentioned ADR.

[source,yaml]
----
---
apiVersion: example.stackable.tech/v1alpha1
kind: ExampleCluster
metadata:
  name: example
spec:
  roleConfig:
    labels:
      foo: bar
      baz: foo
----

==== Option 4 - Leave as is

Continue to use `podOverrides`. Don't introduce dedicated support for labels using above mentioned options 1-3.

== Thoughts on the Implementation

=== General Notes

* Each stack/demo will be deployed into its own namespace. This enables `stackablectl demo installed`
* Each namespace has a label attached, see xref:#ns-labels[above].

=== `stackablectl demo install <name>`

[source]
----
if -n set {
  if ns exists -> Error or propose different ns
} else {
  if ns exists {
    echo "Already installed. Install again?"
    ns += suffix
  }
}

if demo/stack not supports ns {
  return Error
}

if ns not exists {
  create_ns_with_label()
}

template_plain_yaml_cluster_scope()

install_demo()
----

=== `stackablectl demo uninstall <name>`

[source]
----
for chart in helmCharts.reverse() {
  chart.uninstall()
}

// AuthClass, SecretClass, ClusterRole, ClusterRoleBinding, etc...
delete_resources_with_label()

// Also deletes PVCs, operators are not uninstalled
delete_ns_with_label()
----

=== `stackablectl demo installed`

[source]
----
for demo in demos_with_label("demo-*") {
  echo demo
}
----

== Results

* **Scope:** Do not use scopes for now. Add it in the future if needed.
* **Labeling all Resources with a Vendor Label:** Yes, use `stackable.tech/vendor=Stackable`
* **Labeling Resources deployed within a Demo or Stack:** Yes, use `stackable-<demo|stack>-<demo-name|stack-name>(-suffix)`
  with `suffix` being optional and the implementation not yet decided on.
* **Namespacing Stacks and Demos:** Yes, use `stackable-<demo|stack>-<demo-name|stack-name>(-suffix)`
* **Adding Label to indicate which Management Tool was used:** Yes, use
  `stackable.tech/managed-by=stackablectl|stackable-cockpit`
* **Enabling Custom Labels provided by Users:** No support for now. Add it in the future if this feature is requested.
