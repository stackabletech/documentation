Technical Story: https://github.com/stackabletech/issues/issues/361

== Context

There are many use cases for the future development of the SDP that involve https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/extensible-admission-controllers/[validating, mutating] and https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubernetes/custom-resources/custom-resource-definition-versioning/[conversion] webhooks. Tasks that must be tackled in the near future include:

- The proper versioning of our CRDs and the possibility of smoothly up- and downgrading between versions including breaking changes (see https://github.com/stackabletech/documentation/issues/273)
- Fixing the commons operator initial restarting problem (see https://github.com/stackabletech/commons-operator/issues/111 and spike https://github.com/stackabletech/commons-operator/tree/spike/sts-restarter-webhook)
- Inject logging / vector sidecar containers (mutating)

When the Kubernetes API server receives an incoming request, for example when a custom resource should be created, webhooks can intercept that request after authentication and authorization.
The following steps are performed before the server finally persists the object into etcd.

1. Authentication / Authorization
2. Mutating admission
3. Schema validation
4. Validation admission
5. Conversion to storage version

The steps 2 to 4 may run in a loop if multiple mutating admissions are performed and can have side effects.

In order for the Kubernetes API server to contact webhook controllers, the webhook endpoints have to present a certificate trusted by the Kubernetes API server.
This can be configured similarly for conversion and validating / mutating webhooks as follows.

[[conversion_webhooks_ca_example]]
=== Conversion webhooks CA configuration

The following snippet shows a CRD containing multiple versions (`v1beta1`, `v1`) with different schemas.
The `v1beta1` is still the storage version.
Due to schema changes, any custom resource deployed as version `v1` requires a conversion webhook.

The `conversion.webhook.clientConfig.service` points to an endpoint where the actual conversion from an applied `v1` to the stored `v1beta1` takes place.
The Kubernetes API server must trust the endpoint for which a certificate is provided / injected in `conversion.webhook.clientConfig.caBundle`.
The CA bundle in this case is injected via a Cert-Manager annotation that is discussed later in this document.

[source,yaml]

=== Validating / Mutating webhooks CA configuration

The following snippet shows a `ValidatingWebhookConfiguration` which is similar to a `MutatingWebhookConfiguration`.
The `webhooks.clientConfig` is configured as for the conversion webhook above.
The `webhooks.clientConfig.service` points to the endpoint where the webhook is served an must be trusted by the Kubernetes API server via `webhooks.clientConfig.caBundle`.
The CA bundle in this case is injected via a Cert-Manager annotation that is discussed later in this document.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1
kind: ValidatingWebhookConfiguration # or MutatingWebhookConfiguration
metadata:
  name: "example-validating-webhook-server"
  annotations:
    cert-manager.io/inject-ca-from-secret: default/example-conversion-webhook-ca
webhooks:
  - name: my-webhook.example.com
    matchPolicy: Equivalent
    rules:
      - operations: ['CREATE','UPDATE']
        apiGroups: ['*']
        apiVersions: ['*']
        resources: ['*']
    failurePolicy: "Ignore" # Fail-open (optional)
    sideEffects: None
    clientConfig:
      service:
        namespace: default
        name: example-validation-webhook-server # or example-mutating-webhook-server
        path: /validate # or /mutate
      #caBundle: will be injected from a Secret 'default/example-conversion-webhook-ca' with a 'ca.crt' data key
----

The `clientConfig.caBundle` cannot be shipped by us as it will differ from cluster to cluster and must be injected at runtime.

This ADR is about how to achieve the CA bundle injection using external tools or a self-made solution via the secret-operator.

== Problem Statement

The required CA bundles for the webhooks endpoints must be injected at runtime.
There exist tools like https://cert-manager.io/docs/concepts/ca-injector/#injecting-ca-data-from-a-certificate-resource[Cert Manager] that do exactly this, adding one of these annotations to an injectable source:

. `cert-manager.io/inject-ca-from`
. `cert-manager.io/inject-ca-from-secret`
. `cert-manager.io/inject-apiserver-ca`

For example injecting a CA from a secret using Cert-Manager:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1
kind: ValidatingWebhookConfiguration
metadata:
  name: my-webhook.example.com
  annotations:
    cert-manager.io/inject-ca-from-secret: default/my-webhook-example-com-ca
----

This can be used for CRDs and conversion webhooks as well as shown in <<conversion_webhooks_ca_example>>.

The SDP should focus on one solution for CA injection, internally or externally, but strive for compatibility with as many others as possible.
The normal way of configuration seems to be adding an annotation to the objects containing the CA, which can be supported in our Helm chart or solved via documentation.

For clusters without any existing manager we should provide our own, lightweight caBundle injector that can work in tandem with the secret operator.

=== Notes on OLM

The Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) is a core component of OpenShift.
It is used to install, manage, and upgrade the lifecycle of all Operators and their associated services running across a cluster.
It is the recommended way to install and manage operators on OpenShift. OLM is also used to install the Stackable Operator Framework.

Operators and webhooks managed by OLM are automatically injected with the CA bundle from the cluster.
This is done by the OLM itself and does not require any additional configuration.

OLM patches the CustomResourceDefinition (CRD) marked as `owned` with the CA bundle from the cluster and mounts certificates and keys in the webhook Pods.
The keys are in the EC format (as of version 4.14 of OpenShift).

OLM mounts the TLS key and certificate for the webhook at the following locations:

 * The TLS certificate file is mounted to the deployment at `/apiserver.local.config/certificates/apiserver.crt`.
* The TLS key file is mounted to the deployment at `/apiserver.local.config/certificates/apiserver.key`.

For more details regarding OLM constraints for webhooks, see the OpenShift Container Platform https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.14/operators/operator_sdk/osdk-generating-csvs.html#olm-webhook-considerations_osdk-generating-csvs[documentation].

== Decision Drivers

* Generic solution to be compatible with as many external cert providers as possible to avoid vendor lock-in.
  This means a possible abstraction to support switching out cert providers / "backends".
* Openshift compatibility.
* How to activate / deactivate if e.g. no conversion webhooks should be applied?
  This is about how we e.g. set inject annotations via templating / Helm.

== Considered Options

[[option1]]
=== https://cert-manager.io/[Cert-Manager]

The cert-manager is a powerful and extensible X.509 certificate controller for Kubernetes and OpenShift workloads.
It supports certificates from a variety of popular private and public Issuers (HashiCorp, Lets encrypt and many more).
The cert-manager ensures that the certificates are valid and up-to-date, and will attempt to renew certificates at a configured time before expiry.

[[option2]]
=== https://github.com/openshift/service-ca-operator/blob/master/README.md[OpenShift Service CA operator]

The OpenShift Service CA operator is an OpenShift ClusterOperator and contains several controllers:

* *Serving cert signer*: Issues a signed serving certificate/key pair to services annotated with `service.beta.openshift.io/serving-cert-secret-name` via a secret
* *ConfigMap CA bundle injector*: Watches for configmaps annotated with `service.beta.openshift.io/inject-cabundle=true` and adds or updates a data item (key `service-ca.crt`) containing the PEM-encoded CA signing bundle.
  Consumers of the configmap can then trust `service-ca.crt` in their TLS client configuration, allowing connections to services that utilize service-serving certificates.
  Pods referencing the `service-ca.crt` in a VolumeMount will not start before the CA bundle was injected.

[[option3]]
=== Lightweight self-made solution via secret-operator

This would be the Stackable internal solution to avoid any external party tools.
It would work in a similar way to the OpenShift Service CA operator but would rather inject the bundles via the CSI instead of ConfigMap mounts.

[[option4]]
=== Common library for cert management / injection in operator-rs

Put the cert management / injection stuff into a library in operator-rs (similar to the code in secret-operator) that we run in-process for each operator that has a webhook.
The operator / webhook code will use a common TLS utility crate which handles creation of CAs and other certificates on-the-fly.
These certificates will be rotated automatically when they expire.
The webhook server will pick up the renewed certificate without the need for a restart.
Webhooks created by the common `stackable-webhook` crate can also use a certificate which is not autogenerated by us and provided via a Kubernetes Secret from external sources.
For references, see:

* the https://github.com/stackabletech/commons-operator/tree/spike/sts-restarter-webhook[commons-operator spike],
* the https://github.com/stackabletech/operator-rs/pull/736[TLS utility crate PR], and
* the https://github.com/stackabletech/operator-rs/pull/730[webhook server PR].

== Pros and Cons of the Options

=== <<option1>>

* Good, because covers both Kubernetes and Openshift
* Good, because cert injection works via annotations (compatibility) for various Kubernetes Resources (CRDs, Validating/Mutating webhooks)
* Good, because it is already popular and familiar to users
* Good, because it frees maintenance and development resources for us
* Bad, because another tool we have to be experienced with, check for updates and breaking features etc.

=== <<option2>>

* Good, because cert injection works via annotations (compatibility)
* Bad, because specific to OpenShift
* Bad, because only injecting to ConfigMaps
* Bad, because another tool we have to be experienced with, check for updates and breaking features etc.

=== <<option3>>

* Good, because no external tools are required
* Good, because reusing secret-operator and cert management should be an internal part of the SDP
* Bad, because requires more time and coding
* Bad, because secret-operator must version its own CRDs as well which could be a predicament

=== <<option4>>

* Good, because no external tools are required
* Good, because external tools can be used if required
* Bad, because requires more time and coding

== Decision Outcome

Chosen option <<option4>>, because the CA injection will be handled as part of the SDP and no external dependencies are required.
The common library will reside in the operator-rs and be used in every operator.
OpenShift should not pose a problem since no extra components are necessary.
The required infrastructure (e.g. operator-templating, ca injection / generation) can be developed in parallel to the operators e.g. version conversion logic.

=== Positive Consequences

* No external dependencies
* CA bundle injection as basic part of the SDP
* Opt-out (e.g. removing the conversion webhook from CRD) possible
