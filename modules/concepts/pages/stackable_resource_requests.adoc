Stackable operators handle resource requests in a sligtly different manner than Kubernetes. Resource requests are defined on role or group level. See xref:concepts:roles-and-role-groups.adoc[] for details on these concepts. On a role level this means that e.g. all workers will use the same resource requests and limits. This can be further specified on role group level (which takes priority to the role level) to apply different resources.

This is an example on how to specify CPU and memory resources using the Stackable https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/[Custom Resources]:

[source, yaml]

---
apiVersion: example.stackable.tech/v1alpha1
kind: ExampleCluster
metadata:
  name: example
spec:
  workers: # role-level
    config:
      resources:
        cpu:
          min: 300m
          max: 600m
        memory:
          limit: 3Gi
    roleGroups: # role-group-level
      resources-from-role: # role-group 1
        replicas: 1
      resources-from-role-group: # role-group 2
        replicas: 1
        config:
          resources:
            cpu:
              min: 400m
              max: 800m
            memory:
              limit: 4Gi
----

In this case, the role group `resources-from-role` will inherit the resources specified on the role level. Resulting in a maximum of `3Gi` memory and `600m` CPU resources.

The role group `resources-from-role-group` has maximum of `4Gi` memory and `800m` CPU resources (which overrides the role CPU resources).

IMPORTANT: For Java products the actual used Heap memory is lower than the specified memory limit due to other processes in the Container requiring memory to run as well. Currently, 80% of the specified memory limits is passed to the JVM.

For memory only a limit can be specified, which will be set as memory request and limit in the Container. This is to always guarantee a Container the full amount memory during Kubernetes scheduling.
