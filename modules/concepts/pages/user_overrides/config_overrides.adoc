= Config overrides

WARNING: Overriding certain configurations can lead to faulty clusters. User overrides should only be used as a last resort!

For a role or role group, at the same level of `config`, you can specify `configOverrides` for any of the configuration files the product uses.

An example for an HDFS clusters looks as follows:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: hdfs.stackable.tech/v1alpha1
kind: HdfsCluster
metadata:
  name: simple-hdfs
spec:
  nameNodes: # change to your your role
    config: # [..]
    configOverrides: # on role level
      core-site.xml: # change to your desired configuration file
        fs.trash.interval: "5"
    roleGroups:
      default:
        config: # [..]
        configOverrides: # on rolegroup level, takes precedence over the ones specified at role level
          hdfs-site.xml:
            dfs.namenode.num.checkpoints.retained: "3"
        replicas: 1
----

The role, as well as the configuration file and configuration settings dependents on the individual product.
All override property values must be strings.
The properties will be formatted and escaped correctly into the file format used by the product.
