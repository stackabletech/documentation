= Telemetry signals in operators

Since SDP 25.7.0, all Stackable operators emit multiple signals for telemetry data.
Currently supported signals are:

* Console logs in plain and JSON format
* (Rolling) file logs in JSON format
* OpenTelemetry logs exported via OTLP
* OpenTelemetry traces exported via OTLP

Every signal can be toggled and customized using Helm values.
All fields are grouped under the top-level `telemetry` section.
The following sections describe the available fields their default and supported values.

== Console logs

This signal prints log messages at the selected level and in the selected format to STDOUT.
These logs are useful for quick debugging.
For a more complete debugging experience, we recommend the OpenTelemetry signals.

[source,yaml]
----
telemetry:
  consoleLog:
    enabled: true # <1>
    level: null   # <2>
    format: null  # <3>
----

<1> Boolean: `true, false`
<2> Enum: `error, warning, info, debug, trace`
<3> Enum: `plain, json`

== File logs

This signal writes log messages at the selected level in JSON to (rolling) log file(s).
These logs can be picked up by log aggregation systems, like Vector.

[source,yaml]
----
telemetry:
  fileLog:
    enabled: false         # <1>
    level: null            # <2>
    rotationPeriod: hourly # <3>
    maxFiles: 6            # <4>
----

<1> Boolean: `true, false`
<2> Enum: `error, warning, info, debug, trace`
<3> Enum: `never, daily, hourly, minutely`
<4> Unsigned Integer
