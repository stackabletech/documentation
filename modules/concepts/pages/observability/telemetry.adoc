= Telemetry signals in operators

Since SDP 25.7.0, all Stackable operators emit multiple signals for telemetry data.
Currently supported signals are:

* Console logs in plain and JSON format
* (Rolling) file logs in JSON format
* OpenTelemetry logs exported via OTLP
* OpenTelemetry traces exported via OTLP

Every signal can be toggled and customized using Helm values.
All fields are grouped under the top-level `telemetry` section.
The following sections describe the available fields their default and supported values.

== Console logs

This signal prints log messages at the selected level and in the selected format to STDOUT.
These logs are useful for quick debugging.
For a more complete debugging experience, we recommend the OpenTelemetry signals.
