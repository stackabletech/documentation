= Duration format

All Stackable operators use a human-readable duration format. It very closely resembles the format used by the {go}[Go] programming language - which Kubernetes uses internally.
Every duration field of a {k8s-cr}[CustomResource], for example, the xref:trino:usage-guide/operations/graceful-shutdown.adoc[`spec.workers.roleConfig.gracefulShutdownTimeout`] field, supports this format.
There is no official format specification, but the source code of {go-std-time}[`time.ParseDuration`] in the Go standard library can be used as an implementation reference.

The format looks like this: `15d18h34m42s`.
xref:trino:index.adoc[Trino], for example, uses it in the following way:

[source,yaml]
----
# ...
spec:
  workers:
    roleConfig:
      gracefulShutdownTimeout: 15d18h34m42s
----

Valid time units are: `d`, `h`, `m`, `s`, and `ms`.
Separating the duration fragments, which is a tuple of time value and time unit (`15d`), by spaces is **not** supported and will result in an error.
The maximum amount of time which can safely be represented without precision loss or integer overflow is 584,942,417,355 years.
See {rust-duration-max}[here] for more information.
