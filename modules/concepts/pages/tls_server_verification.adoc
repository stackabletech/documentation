= TLS server verification

A TLS section is part of Stackable CRDs and describes how to connect to a TLS enabled system like LDAP or S3.

If the `tls` attribute is set to `null` (or is not specified), no TLS will be used for the connection.

A simple TLS section looks like this:

[source,yaml]

include::example$tls-simple.yaml[]

== Verification
The parties participating via a TLS connection can be verified using certificates.
At the moment the following verification methods are supported:

* <<No verification>>
* <<Server verification>>
* <<Mutual verification>>

=== No verification
This example will use TLS but not perform any checks on the certificate presented by the server or present a client certificate if asked for one by the server.

[source,yaml]

include::example$tls-no-verification.yaml[]
----

=== Server verification
This example will use TLS and verify the server using the ca certificates that are trusted by common web browsers.
This can be useful when you e.g. use public AWS S3 or other public available services.

[source,yaml]

include::example$tls-server-verification-webpki.yaml[]

This example will use TLS and verify the server using the provided ca certificate.
For this to work you need to create a xref:secret-operator::secretclass.adoc[] that - at least - contains the ca certificate.
Note that a SecretClass does not need to have a key but can also work with just a ca cert.
So if you were provided with a ca cert but do not have access to the key you can still use this method.

=== Mutual verification
This example will use TLS and verify both - the server and the client using certificates.
For this to work you need to create a xref:secret-operator::secretclass.adoc[] containing the ca certificate and a key to create new client-certificates.
The xref:secret-operator::index.adoc[] will automatically provide the product with a `ca.crt`, `tls.crt` and `tls.key` so that the product can authenticate the server and it can authenticate itself at the server.
