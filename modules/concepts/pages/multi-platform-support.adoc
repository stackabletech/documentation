WARNING: This status is still experimental, as we work to fine-tune the necessary workflows.

== Description

Starting with Stackable release 24.7, all images are {multi-platform-images}[multi-platform images], supporting the AMD64 and ARM64 architectures.
Each product image is built for each platform with a specific tag.
These tags are then bundled as a manifest list using an automated workflow so that the appropriate image can be transparently selected for the active platform/architecture.
This also enables mixed Kubernetes clusters, with AMD64 and ARM64 nodes being used simultaneously.

NOTE: Superset 2.x (deprecated, and to be removed in a future version) is not available as a multi-platform product image.
