= Multi-Architecture for SDP (Experimental)
:description: This page describes how to access ARM64 based SDP early
:keywords: Multi-Architecture, infrastructure, docker, image, tags, early-access

WARNING: This is an experimental feature of the Stackable Data Platform and still under https://github.com/stackabletech/issues/issues/463[development].

== Early-Access

SDP release 23.11.0 has been ported to the ARM64 architecture. These images are stored within the `stackable-experimental` organization in our https://repo.stackable.tech/#browse/browse:docker:v2%2Fstackable-experimental[Nexus]. 

As they are not available by default so you need to first switch to the `stackable-experimental` organization before pulling them for use with the data platform.

=== Actual Releases

The only release currently available for ARM64 is the early-access version mentioned above.

Each product is built using ARM-specific tags to keep them distinct from development/nightly images. In future they may be bundled as a manifest list using an automated workflow. 

=== Early-Access with Helm

According to our https://docs.stackable.tech/home/stable/airflow/getting_started/installation#_helm[installation guide] you can install ARM64 operators e.g. for the commons operator as follows:

[source,bash]
----
helm install commons-operator stackable-stable/commons-operator --namespace stackable-operators --create-namespace --version=23.11.0 --set image.repository=docker.stackable.tech/stackable-experimental/commons-operator
----

WARNING: Listener operator 23.11.0 not available for bare metal arm64 machines

By declaring `--set image.repository=docker.stackable.tech/stackable-experimental/commons-operator` you will overwrite the image selected by default with one located in the organization `stackable-experimental`. The other operators can be installed in the same way.

WARNING: You have to install every operator you need for a given demo individually with helm using `--skip-release` with stackablectl. Otherwise, it will try to install x86 operators and pull ARM64 product images afterwards.

=== Early-Access to our products

The https://docs.stackable.tech/home/stable/concepts/product_image_selection[Product image selection] mechanism allows the user to choose a specific product image and/or a different repository which may be relevant for e.g. air-gapped environments or when using a mirrored repository. To choose an ARM64 image specify the image in the `custom` field as follows:

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  image:
    custom: docker.stackable.tech/stackable-experimental/kafka:3.5.1-stackable23.11.0
    productVersion: 3.5.1
----

NOTE: Only 23.11.0 is working at this moment.

=== Prepared Demos

It is possible to run SDP demos on ARM64 architecture, but due to the changes that are necessary we have provided a separate branch to make this easier. Please follow the instructions below to run a demo on ARM.

You will need access to a Kubernetes Cluster and to have the stackablectl https://docs.stackable.tech/home/stable/quickstart[command-line tool] installed.

==== 1. Clone the demo repository
[source,bash]
----
git clone git@github.com:stackabletech/demos.git
----

==== 2. Checkout ARM64 demo branch ( release 23.11.0 )
[source,bash]
----
cd demos && git pull && git checkout spike/demos-on-arm
----
==== 3. Install stackable operators ( release 23.11.0 )
NOTE: This executes a script where all operators (except listener operator) with version 23.11.0 are installed. You can omit this step and only install operators you want by copying the corresponding `helm` command.

[source,bash]
----
./arm.sh
----
==== 4. Install your demo with stackablectl (e.g. nifi-kafka-druid-earthquake-data)
[source,bash]
----
stackablectl demo install nifi-kafka-druid-earthquake-data --skip-release -s stacks/stacks-v2.yaml -d demos/demos-v2.yaml
----
