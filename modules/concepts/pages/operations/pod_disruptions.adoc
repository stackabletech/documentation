= Allowed Pod disruptions

Any downtime of our products is generally considered to be bad.
Although downtime can't be prevented 100% of the time - especially if the product does not support High Availability - we can try to do our best to reduce it to an absolute minimum.

Kubernetes has mechanisms to ensure minimal *planned* downtime.
Please keep in mind, that this only affects planned (voluntary) downtime of Pods - unplanned Kubernetes node crashes can always occur.

Our product operator will always deploy so-called https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/configure-pdb/[PodDisruptionBudget (PDB)] resources alongside the products.
For every role that you specify (e.g. HDFS namenodes or Trino workers) a PDB is created.

== Default values
The defaults depend on the individual product and can be found below the "Operations" usage guide.

They are based on our knowledge of each product's fault tolerance.
In some cases they may be a little pessimistic, but they can be adjusted as documented in the following sections.

== Influencing and disabling PDBs

You can configure

1. Whether PDBs are written at all
2. The `maxUnavailable` replicas for this role PDB

The following example

1. Sets `maxUnavailable` for NameNodes to `1`
2. Sets `maxUnavailable` for DataNodes to `10`, which allows downtime of 10% of the total DataNodes.
3. Disables PDBs for JournalNodes

== Using you own custom PDBs
In case you are not satisfied with the PDBs that are written by the operators, you can deploy your own.

WARNING: In case you write custom PDBs, it is your responsibility to take care of the availability of the products

IMPORTANT: It is important to disable the PDBs created by the Stackable operators as described above before creating your own PDBs, as this is a https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/75957[limitation of Kubernetes].

*After disabling the Stackable PDBs*, you can deploy you own PDB such as

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: policy/v1
kind: PodDisruptionBudget
metadata:
  name: hdfs-journalnode-and-namenode
spec:
  maxUnavailable: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app.kubernetes.io/name: hdfs
      app.kubernetes.io/instance: hdfs
    matchExpressions:
      - key: app.kubernetes.io/component
        operator: In
        values:
          - journalnode
          - namenode
----

This PDB allows only one Pod out of all the Namenodes and Journalnodes to be down at one time.
