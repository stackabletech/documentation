= Overrides

The Stackable Operators configure the products they are operating with sensible defaults and required settings to enable connectivity and security.
Other important settings are usually exposed as settings in the resource definition.
In some cases however, you might want to set certain settings that are not exposed, or override settings that the operator has set on the product.

The resource definitions of all products support overrides, specifically for the product configuration, environment variables, and the PodSpec the operators generate.

WARNING: Overriding certain configuration properties can lead to faulty clusters. Overrides should only be used as a last resort!

The cluster definitions also supports overriding configuration aspects, either per xref:roles-and-role-groups.adoc[role or per role group], where the more specific override (role group) has precedence over the less specific one (role).

== Config overrides

For a xref:roles-and-role-groups.adoc[role or role group], at the same level of `config`, you can specify `configOverrides` for any of the configuration files the product uses.

An example for an HDFS cluster looks as follows:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: hdfs.stackable.tech/v1alpha1
kind: HdfsCluster
metadata:
  name: simple-hdfs
spec:
  nameNodes: # change to your your role
    config: # [..]
    configOverrides: # on role level
      core-site.xml: # change to your desired configuration file
        fs.trash.interval: "5"
    roleGroups:
      default:
        config: # [..]
        configOverrides: # on rolegroup level, takes precedence over the ones specified at role level
          hdfs-site.xml:
            dfs.namenode.num.checkpoints.retained: "3"
        replicas: 1
----

The role, as well as the configuration file and configuration settings available depend on the specific product.
All override property values must be strings.
The properties will be formatted and escaped correctly into the file format used by the product.

== Environment variable overrides

For a xref:roles-and-role-groups.adoc[role or role group], at the same level of `config`, you can specify `envOverrides` for any env variable

An example for an HDFS cluster looks as follows:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: hdfs.stackable.tech/v1alpha1
kind: HdfsCluster
metadata:
  name: simple-hdfs
spec:
  nameNodes: # change to your your role
    config: # [..]
    envOverrides: # on role level
      MY_ENV_VAR: "MY_VALUE"
    configOverrides: # on role level
      core-site.xml: # change to your desired configuration file
        fs.trash.interval: "5"
    roleGroups:
      default:
        config: # [..]
        envOverrides: # on rolegroup level, takes precedence over the ones specified at role level
          MY_ENV_VAR: "MY_VALUE"
        replicas: 1
----

You can set any environment variable, but every specific product does support a different set of environment variables.
All override property values must be strings.

== Pod overrides

For a xref:roles-and-role-groups.adoc[role or role group], at the same level of `config`, you can specify `podOverrides` for any of the attributes you can configure on a Pod.

An example for an HDFS cluster looks as follows:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: hdfs.stackable.tech/v1alpha1
kind: HdfsCluster
metadata:
  name: simple-hdfs
spec:
  nameNodes: # change to your your role
    config: # [..]
    podOverrides: # on role level
      spec:
        tolerations:
          - key: "key1"
            operator: "Equal"
            value: "value1"
            effect: "NoSchedule"
    roleGroups:
      default:
        config: # [..]
        podOverrides: # on rolegroup level, takes precedence over the ones specified at role level
          metadata:
            labels:
              my-custom-label: super-important-label
        replicas: 1
----

The `podOverrides` can be any valid `PodTemplateSpec` (which means every property that you can set on a regular Kubernetes Pod).

The priority of how to construct the final Pod submitted to Kubernetes looks as follows (low to high):

1. PodTemplateSpec calculated by operator
2. PodTemplateSpec given in role level `podOverrides`
3. PodTemplateSpec given in rolegroup level `podOverrides`

Each of these are combined top to bottom using a deep merge.
The exact merge algorithm is described in the https://arnavion.github.io/k8s-openapi/v0.18.x/k8s_openapi/trait.DeepMerge.html[k8s-openapi docs], which basically tries to mimic the way Kubernetes merges patches onto objects.

The `podOverrides` will be merged onto the following resources the operators deploy:

* StatefulSets containing the products (most of the products)
* DaemonSets containing the products (currently only OPA)
* Deployments containing the products (currently no product, but there might be Deployments in the future)

They will *not* be applied to:

* Jobs, that are used to setup systems the product depends on e.g. create a database schema for Superset oder Airflow.
