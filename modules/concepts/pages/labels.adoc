= Labels




// Intro TODO

Which labels, what for?

* recommended labels
** each operator is labeled with "vendor" (and other recommended labels)
** each resource created by an operator is labeled with "vendor" (and other recommended labels)
* when using stackablectl
** stacks and demos
*** all manifests that are part of stacks/demos have a label for that attached. I.e. configmaps, secrets, volumes ....
**** vendor label; dynamic labels: stackablectl was used; part of which stack/demo it is
*** Helm installs (i.e. postgres, redis etc.): ... nothing yet
*** operator installs: operators installed as part of a stack/demo are labeled
*** all the other recommended labels are still applied to resources


* The Helm charts for the operators support adding your own labels to them
** all _templated resources_ (Deployment, ClusterRole, ...) get these labels




// what would be nice to have:
//
// * custom labels
// * operators labeling their resources as part of a stack too
