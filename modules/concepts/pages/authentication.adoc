= Authentication

The Stackable Platform uses the AuthenticationClass as a central mechanism to handle user authentication across supported products.
The authentication mechanism needs to be configured only in the AuthenticationClass which is then referenced in the product.
Multiple different authentication providers are supported.

== AuthenticationClass

The AuthenticationClass is a resource describing a generic authentication method like LDAP or Kerberos.
It has `cluster` scope, so it does not belong to a specific namespace.
Multiple operators use this CRD as a way to express and configure the authentication methods of their respective product.

The following authentication providers are supported:

* <<LDAP>>: Authenticate users using an LDAP server.
* <<TLS>>: Authenticate users with client TLS certificates.
* <<Static>>: Authenticate users against a static list of users and passwords in a simple Kubernetes Secret.

=== LDAP
A very simple AuthenticationClass with LDAP Authentication looks like this:

[source,yaml]
----
include::example$authenticationclass-ldap-simple.yaml[]
----
<1> The hostname of the LDAP server without any protocol or port
<2> The port of the LDAP server. If TLS is used it defaults to `636` otherwise to `389`
<3> An optional searchBase where the users should be searched
<4> The reference to the SecretClass for the bind credentials

In a diagram it would look like this:

NOTE: For more details, look at the xref:reference:authenticationclass.adoc[AuthenticationClass reference] as well as the xref:tutorials:authentication_with_openldap.adoc[OpenLDAP tutorial].

=== TLS
The `TLS` provider configures a product to authenticate users using TLS certificates.
When establishing a connection the client will first validate the certificate of the server.
This step is not influenced by this `AuthenticationClass`, it only affects the next step:
Afterwards the server checks the validity of the certificate the client has provided.
This includes the usual checks - such as checking that it hasn't expired and matches the hostname of the client.
Additionally the client certificate needs to be signed with the `ca` certificate, which is provided by the `SecretClass` specified in `clientCertSecretClass`.

A sample TLS provider looks as follows:

[source,yaml]
----
include::example$authenticationclass-tls.yaml[]
----

=== Static
The `static` provider is used to represent a simple - static - set of users.
Users are identified by a username and a password.

First, the `AuthenticationClass` needs to be defined as follows:

[source,yaml]
----
include::example$authenticationclass-static-authenticationclass.yaml[]
----
<1> The name of the `Secret` containing the credentials

Afterwards the referenced `Secret` needs to be created:

[source,yaml]
----
include::example$authenticationclass-static-secret.yaml[]
----
<1> The name of the `Secret`, which needs to match the `Secret` name specified in the `AuthenticationClass` above
<2> The namespace of the `Secret`. The `Secret` needs to be in the same namespace as the product that tries to use the static `AuthenticationClass`
