// syntax explanation:
// - the [[...]] creates an anchor at the list item
// - The <<...>> creates a link to the achor
// - The {li} references the pass that you can find at the top of the document, it is a FontAwesome icon
// - The ...:: is the syntax for a definition list item
// - The {empty} followed by the + means that there is no "normal" list item, instead there is a block
// - The period followed by text is the summary of a details block that is collapsed
// - Inside the "====" is the details of the details block.
//
// Please create new entries the same way! This allows easy linking to glossary items.
// Antora generates dl, dt and dd tages for the definition list, which is great because these are
// semantic HTML tags.
