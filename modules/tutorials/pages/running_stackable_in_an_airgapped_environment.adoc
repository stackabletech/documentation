= Running Stackable in an air-gapped environment

The main challenge with running Stackable in an air-gapped environment is how to get the artifacts (container images and Helm charts) into the environment. There are a few ways to do this:

* Mirror our images and Helm charts to a registry (e.g. https://goharbor.io/[Harbor]) in the air-gapped environment. This is the recommended approach. If you use Harbor and the instance running Harbor has internet connection, you can setup https://goharbor.io/docs/latest/administration/configuring-replication/[replication] to replicate our project `sdp` from our registry `oci.stackable.tech` (and optionally `sdp-charts` as well, if you also need access to Stackable's Helm charts from within your air-gapped environment). Otherwise, you need to transfer the images that are relevant to you from the `sdp` project in `oci.stackable.tech` to your registry manually.
* If possible, setup a reverse proxy to Stackable's registry on a node with internet connection that is reachable from all nodes within your air-gapped environment. You could, for example, use https://distribution.github.io/distribution/[distribution] for this. Here's a command to spin up a pull-through cache to `oci.stackable.tech` on port 5001: `docker run -d --name proxy-stackable -p 5001:5000 --restart=always -e REGISTRY_PROXY_REMOTEURL=https://oci.stackable.tech registry:2`. The registry is now available on localhost:5001 via HTTP. Once an image has been loaded, it will be cached by the proxy.
* Download our images (e.g. using `docker save`) on a machine with internet access, copy them onto the nodes in your air-gapped environment and load them (e.g. using `ctr images import`). Then render the Helm charts using the `helm template` subcommand, copy the rendered YAML files your air-gapped environment and apply them.

In the first two scenarios, you need to make sure that the nodes load the images from your local registry mirror. Again, there are a several ways to do this:

* Specify the image repository in the CRDs (see https://docs.stackable.tech/home/nightly/concepts/product-image-selection#_custom_docker_registry["Custom docker registry"]) and in the values of the Helm charts when installing the operators (`helm install --set image.repository="my.custom.registry/stackable/nifi-operator" ...`).
* If you use `containerd` as your container runtime, you can patch the `containerd` config on every node to use the mirrored registry instead of `oci.stackable.tech`. +
Example: Create the file `/etc/containerd/certs.d/oci.stackable.tech/hosts.toml` with the following contents:
+
[source,toml]
----
server = "http://10.7.228.12"

[host."10.7.228.12"]
  ca = "/etc/pki/tls/certs/mycert.crt"
----
+
Note that `/etc/pki/tls/certs/mycert.crt` has to contain the IP (`10.7.228.12` in the example) as SAN. +
Modify your containerd config (usually located at `/etc/containerd/config.toml`):
+
[source,toml]
----
[plugins."io.containerd.grpc.v1.cri".registry]
   config_path = "/etc/containerd/certs.d"
----
Then restart the `containerd` service.

* Add an alias for `oci.stackable.tech` to the `/etc/hosts` file on every node (like `10.7.228.12 oci.stackable.tech`), issue a self-signed certificate for `oci.stackable.tech` to your registry and add the certificate to the trusted certificates on every node. Note that if you also want to enforce signature checks for Stackable's images via a policy controller, you will need to add this host alias to the Pod of the policy controller as well (and make it trust the certificate).
