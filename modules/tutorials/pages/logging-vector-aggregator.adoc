= Logging with a Vector log aggregator
:description: A tutorial on how to set up a Vector log aggregator to use with the Stackable Data Platform.
:keywords: logging, observability, log aggregation, Kubernetes, k8s, Vector, ZooKeeper

This tutorial teaches you how to deploy a Vector aggregator together with a product - in this case ZooKeeper - and how to configure both of them so the logs are sent from the product to the aggregator.
Logging on the Stackable Data Platform is always configured in the same way, so you can use this knowledge to configure logging in any product that you want to deploy.

Prerequisites:

* a k8s cluster available, or https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/[kind] installed
* xref:management:stackablectl:index.adoc[] installed
* https://helm.sh/[Helm] installed to deploy Vector
* basic knowledge of how to create resources in Kubernetes (i.e. `kubectl apply -f <filename>.yaml`) and inspect them
  (`kubectl get` or a tool like https://k9scli.io/[k9s])

== Install the ZooKeeper operator

Install the Stackable Operator for Apache ZooKeeper and its dependencies, so you can deploy a ZooKeeper instance later.

[source,bash]
include::example$logging-aggregator/main.sh[tag=zk-op]

== Install the Vector aggregator

Install the Vector aggregator using Helm.
First, create a `vector-aggregator-values.yaml` file with the Helm values:

[source,yaml]
include::example$logging-aggregator/vector-aggregator-values.yaml[]

<1> define a source of `type` `vector` which listens to incoming log messages at port 6000.
<2> define a `console` sink, logging all received logs to `stderr`.

Deploy Vector with these values using Helm:

[source,bash]
include::example$logging-aggregator/main.sh[tag=vector-agg]

This is a minimal working configuration. The source should be defined in this way, but you can configure different sinks, depending on your needs.
You can find an https://vector.dev/docs/reference/configuration/sinks/[overview] of all sinks in the Vector documentation, specifically the https://vector.dev/docs/reference/configuration/sinks/elasticsearch/[Elasticsearch] sink might be useful, it also works when configured with OpenSearch.

To make the Vector aggregator discoverable to ZooKeeper, deploy a xref:concepts:service_discovery.adoc[discovery ConfigMap] called `vector-aggregator-discovery`.
Create a file called `vector-aggregator-discovery.yaml`:

[source,yaml]
include::example$logging-aggregator/vector-aggregator-discovery.yaml[]

and apply it:

[source,bash]
include::example$logging-aggregator/main.sh[tag=vector-discovery]

== Install ZooKeeper

Now that the aggregator is running, you can install a ZooKeeper cluster which is configured to send logs to the aggregator.

Create a file called `zookeeper.yaml` with the following ZookeeperCluster definition:

[source,yaml]
include::example$logging-aggregator/zookeeper.yaml[]

<1> This is the reference to the discovery ConfigMap created in the previous step.
<2> This is the logging configuration, where logging is first enabled and then a few settings are made.

and apply it:

[source,bash]
include::example$logging-aggregator/main.sh[tag=zk]

TIP: You can learn more about how to configure logging in a product at the xref:concepts:logging.adoc[logging concept documentation].

== Watch the logs

During startup, ZooKeeper already prints out log messages.
Vector was configured to print the aggregated logs to `stderr`, so if you look at the logs of the Vector pod, you will see the ZooKeeper logs:


[source,bash]
include::example$logging-aggregator/main.sh[tag=grep]

You should see a JSON object per ZooKeeper replica printed that looks like

[source,json]
{
  "cluster": "simple-zk",
  "container": "zookeeper",
  "file": "zookeeper.log4j.xml",
  "level": "INFO",
  "logger": "org.apache.zookeeper.server.ZooKeeperServer",
  "message": "Server environment:zookeeper.version=3.8.0-5a02a05eddb59aee6ac762f7ea82e92a68eb9c0f, built on 2022-02-25 08:49 UTC",
  "namespace": "default",
  "pod": "simple-zk-server-default-0",
  "role": "server",
  "roleGroup": "default",
  "source_type": "vector",
  "timestamp": "2023-11-06T10:30:40.223Z"
}

The JSON object contains a timestamp, the log message, log level and some additional information.

You can see the same log line in the log output of the ZooKeeper container:

[source]
kubectl logs \
  --container=zookeeper simple-zk-server-default-0 \
  | grep "zookeeper.version="

[source]
2023-11-06 10:30:40,223 [myid:1] - INFO  [main:o.a.z.Environment@98] - Server environment:zookeeper.version=3.8.0-5a02a05eddb59aee6ac762f7ea82e92a68eb9c0f, built on 2022-02-25 08:49 UTC

Congratulations, this concludes the tutorial!

== What's next?

Look into different sink configurations which are more suited to production use in the https://vector.dev/docs/reference/configuration/sinks/[sinks overview documetation] or learn more about how logging works on the platform in the xref:concepts:logging.adoc[concepts documentation].
