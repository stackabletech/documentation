:description: A tutorial on how to configure various aspects of JupyterHub on Kubernetes.
:keywords: notebook, JupyterHub, Kubernetes, k8s, Apache Spark, HDFS, S3

This tutorial illustrates various scenarios and configuration options when using JupyterHub on Kubernetes.
The Custom Resources and configuration settings that are discussed here are based on the xref:demos:jupyterhub-keycloak.adoc[JupyterHub-Keycloak demo], so you may find it helpful to have that demo running to reference the various https://github.com/stackabletech/demos/blob/main/stacks/jupyterhub-keycloak[Resource definitions] as you read through this tutorial.
The example notebook is used to demonstrate simple read/write interactions with an S3 storage backend using Apache Spark.

== Keycloak

Keycloak is installed using a https://github.com/stackabletech/demos/blob/main/stacks/jupyterhub-keycloak/keycloak.yaml[Deployment] that loads its realm configuration mounted as a ConfigMap.

[#services]
=== Services

In the demo, the Keycloak and JupyterHub service (`proxy-public`) ports are fixed e.g.

[source,yaml]
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: keycloak
  labels:
    app: keycloak
spec:
  type: NodePort
  selector:
    app: keycloak
  ports:
    - name: https
      port: 8443
      targetPort: 8443
      nodePort: 31093 # <1>
----

<1> Static value for the purposes of the demo

They are:

- `31093` for Keycloak
- `31095` for JupyterHub/proxy-public

The Keycloak and JupyterHub endpoints are defined in the JupyterHub chart values i.e. for the purposes of the demo (that does not use any pre-defined DNS settings), the ports have to be known before the JupyterHub components are deployed.

This can be achieved by having the Keycloak Deployment write out its node URL and node IP into a ConfigMap during start-up, which can then be referenced by the JupyterHub chart like this:

[source,yaml]
----
options:
  hub:
    config:
      ...
    extraEnv:
      ...
      KEYCLOAK_NODEPORT_URL:
        valueFrom:
          configMapKeyRef:
            name: keycloak-address
            key: keycloakAddress # <1>
      KEYCLOAK_NODE_IP:
        valueFrom:
          configMapKeyRef:
            name: keycloak-address
            key: keycloakNodeIp
    ...
    extraConfig:
      ...
      03-set-endpoints: |
        import os
        from oauthenticator.generic import GenericOAuthenticator
        keycloak_url = os.getenv("KEYCLOAK_NODEPORT_URL")  # <2>
        ...
        keycloak_node_ip = os.getenv("KEYCLOAK_NODE_IP")
        ...
        c.GenericOAuthenticator.oauth_callback_url: f"http://{keycloak_node_ip}:31095/hub/oauth_callback"  # <3>
        c.GenericOAuthenticator.authorize_url = f"https://{keycloak_url}/realms/demo/protocol/openid-connect/auth"
        c.GenericOAuthenticator.token_url = f"https://{keycloak_url}/realms/demo/protocol/openid-connect/token"
        c.GenericOAuthenticator.userdata_url = f"https://{keycloak_url}/realms/demo/protocol/openid-connect/userinfo"
----

<1> Endpoint information read from the ConfigMap
<2> This information is passed to a variable in one of the start-up config scripts
<3> And then used for JupyterHub settings (this is where port `31095` is hard-coded for the proxy service)

NOTE: The node port IP found in the ConfigMap `keycloak-address` can be used for opening the JupyterHub UI.
On Kind this can be any node - not necessarily the one where the proxy Pod is running.
This is due to the way in which Docker networking is used within the cluster.
On other clusters it might be necessary to use the exact Node on which the proxy is running.

=== Discovery

As mentioned above in <<services, Services>>, a Keycloak sidecar Container writes out its endpoint information to a ConfigMap, shown in the code section below.

=== Security

We create a keystore with a self-generated and self-signed certificate and mount it so that the keystore file can be used when starting Keycloak:

[source,yaml]
----
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: keycloak
          ...
          args:
            - start
            - --hostname-strict=false
            - --https-key-store-file=/tls/keystore.p12 # <3>
            - --https-key-store-password=changeit
            - --import-realm
          volumeMounts:
            - name: tls
              mountPath: /tls/ # <2>
        ...
      volumes:
        ...
        - name: tls
          ephemeral:
            volumeClaimTemplate:
              metadata:
                annotations:
                  secrets.stackable.tech/class: tls # <1>
                  secrets.stackable.tech/format: tls-pkcs12
                  secrets.stackable.tech/format.compatibility.tls-pkcs12.password: changeit
                  secrets.stackable.tech/scope: service=keycloak,node
              spec:
                storageClassName: secrets.stackable.tech
                accessModes:
                  - ReadWriteOnce
                resources:
                  requests:
                    storage: "1"
----

<1> Create a volume holding the self-signed certificate information
<2> Mount this volume for Keycloak to use
<3> Pass the keystore file as an argument on start-up

For the self-signed certificate to be accepted during the handshake between JupyterHub and Keycloak it is important to create the JupyterHub-side certificate using the same secret class, although the format can be a different one:

[source,yaml]
----
    extraVolumes:
      - name: tls-ca-cert
        ephemeral:
          volumeClaimTemplate:
            metadata:
              annotations:
                secrets.stackable.tech/class: tls
            spec:
              storageClassName: secrets.stackable.tech
              accessModes:
                - ReadWriteOnce
              resources:
                requests:
                  storage: "1"
----

=== Realm

The Keycloak https://github.com/stackabletech/demos/blob/main/stacks/jupyterhub-keycloak/keycloak-realm-config.yaml[realm configuration] for the demo basically contains a set of users and groups, along with a JupyterHub client definition:

[source,yaml]
----
"clients" : [ {
    "clientId": "jupyterhub",
    "enabled": true,
    "protocol": "openid-connect",
    "clientAuthenticatorType": "client-secret",
    "secret": ...,
    "redirectUris" : [ "*" ],
    "webOrigins" : [ "*" ],
    "standardFlowEnabled": true
  } ]
----

Note that the standard flow is enabled and no other OAuth-specific settings are required.
Wildcards are used for `redirectUris` and `webOrigins`, mainly for the sake of simplicity: in production environments these would typically be limited or filtered in an appropriate way.

== JupyterHub

=== Authentication

This tutorial covers two methods of authentication: Native and OAuth.
Other implementations are documented https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/authenticators.html[here].

==== Native Authenticator

This tutorial and the accompanying demo assume that Keycloak is used for user authentication.
However, a simpler alternative is to use the Native Authenticator that allows users to be added "on-the-fly".

[source,yaml]
----
options:
  hub:
    config:
      Authenticator:
        allow_all: true
        admin_users:
          - admin
      JupyterHub:
        authenticator_class: nativeauthenticator.NativeAuthenticator
      NativeAuthenticator:
        open_signup: true
  proxy:
    ...
----

image::jupyterhub/sign-up.png[Create a user]

Users must either be included in an `allowed_users` list, or the property `allow_all` must be set to `true`.
The creation of new users will be checked against these settings and refused if appropriate.
If an `admin_users` property is defined, then associated users will see an additional tab on the JupyterHub home screen, allowing them to carry out certain user management actions (e.g. create user groups and assign users to them, assign users to the admin role, delete users).

image::jupyterhub/admin-user.png[Admin tab]

NOTE: The above applies to version 4.x of the JupyterHub Helm chart.
Version 3.x does not impose these limitations and users can be added and used without specifying `allowed_users` or `allow_all`.

==== OAuth Authenticator (Keycloak)

To authenticate against a Keycloak instance it is necessary to provide the following:

* configuration for GenericOAuthenticator
* certificates that can be used between JupyterHub and Keycloak
* several URls (callback, authorize etc.) necessary for the authentication handshake
** in this tutorial these URls will be defined dynamically using start-up scripts, a ConfigMap and environment variables

=== GenericOAuthenticator

This section of the JupyterHub configuration specifies that we are using GenericOAuthenticator for our authentication:

[source,yaml]
----
...
  hub:
    config:
      Authenticator:
        # don't filter here: delegate to Keycloak
        allow_all: true # <1>
        admin_users:
          - isla.williams # <2>
      GenericOAuthenticator:
        client_id: jupyterhub
        client_secret: ...
        username_claim: preferred_username
        scope:
          - openid # <3>
      JupyterHub:
        authenticator_class: generic-oauth # <4>
...
----

<1> We need to either provide a list of users using `allowed_users`, or to explicitly allow _all_ users, as done here.
We will delegate this to Keycloak so that we do not have to maintain users in two places
<2> Each admin user will have access to an Admin tab on the JupyterHub UI where certain user-management actions can be carried out
<3> Define the Keycloak scope
<4> Specifies which authenticator class to use

The endpoints can be defined directly under `GenericOAuthenticator` as well, though for our purposes we will set them in a configuration script (see <<endpoints, Endpoints>> below).

=== Certificates

The demo uses a self-signed certificate that needs to be accepted by JupyterHub.
This involves:

* mounting a secret created with the same secret class as used for the self-signed certificate used by Keycloak
* make this secret available to JupyterHub
* it may also be necessary to point python at this specific certificate

This can be seen below:

[source,yaml]
----
    extraEnv: # <1>
      CACERT: /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
      CERT: /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
      CURLOPT_CAINFO: /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
      ...
    extraVolumes:
      - name: tls-ca-cert # <2>
        ephemeral:
          volumeClaimTemplate:
            metadata:
              annotations:
                secrets.stackable.tech/class: tls
            spec:
              storageClassName: secrets.stackable.tech
              accessModes:
                - ReadWriteOnce
              resources:
                requests:
                  storage: "1"
    extraVolumeMounts:
      - name: tls-ca-cert
        # Alternative: mount to another filename in this folder and call update-ca-certificates
        mountPath: /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt # <3>
        subPath: ca.crt
      - name: tls-ca-cert
        mountPath: /usr/local/lib/python3.12/site-packages/certifi/cacert.pem # <4>
        subPath: ca.crt
----

<1> Specify which certificate(s) should be used internally (in the code above this is using the default certificate, but is included for the sake of completion)
<2> Create the certificate with the same secret class (`tls`) as Keycloak
<3> Mount this certificate: if the default file is not overwritten, but is mounted to a new file in the same directory, then the certificates should be updated by calling e.g. `update-ca-certificates`
<4> Ensure python is using the same certificate

[#endpoints]
=== Endpoints

The Helm chart for JupyterHub allows us to augment the standard configuration with one or more scripts.
As mentioned in the <<services, Services>> section above, we want to define the endpoints dynamically - by making use of the ConfigMap written out by the Keycloak Deployment - and we can do this by adding a script under `extraConfig`:

[source,yaml]
----
   extraConfig:
      ...
      03-set-endpoints: |
        import os
        from oauthenticator.generic import GenericOAuthenticator
        keycloak_url = os.getenv("KEYCLOAK_NODEPORT_URL")
        ...
        keycloak_node_ip = os.getenv("KEYCLOAK_NODE_IP")
        ...
        c.GenericOAuthenticator.oauth_callback_url: f"http://{keycloak_node_ip}:31095/hub/oauth_callback"
        c.GenericOAuthenticator.authorize_url = f"https://{keycloak_url}/realms/demo/protocol/openid-connect/auth"
        c.GenericOAuthenticator.token_url = f"https://{keycloak_url}/realms/demo/protocol/openid-connect/token"
        c.GenericOAuthenticator.userdata_url = f"https://{keycloak_url}/realms/demo/protocol/openid-connect/userinfo"
----

[#driver]
=== Driver Service (Spark)

NOTE: When using Spark from within a notebook, please take note of the <<provisos, Provisos>> section below.

In the same way, we can use another script to define a driver service for each user.
This is essential when using Spark from within a JupyterHub notebook so that executor Pods can be spawned from the user's kernel in a user-specific way.
This script instructs JupyterHub to use `KubeSpawner` to create a service referenced by the UID of the parent Pod.

=== Profiles

The `singleuser.profileList` section of the Helm chart values allows us to define notebook profiles by setting the CPU, Memory and Image combinations that can be selected. For instance, the profiles below allows us to select 2/4/etc. CPUs, 4/8/etc. GB RAM and to choose between one of two images.

NOTE: The example notebook in the demo will start a distributed Spark cluster, whereby the notebook acts as the driver which spawns a number of executors.
The driver uses the user-specific <<driver, driver service>> to pass job dependencies to each executor.
The Spark versions of these dependencies must be the same on both the driver and executor, or else serialization errors can occur.
For Java or Scala classes that do not have a specified `serialVersionUID`, one will be calculated at runtime based on the contents of each class (method signatures etc.): if the contents of these class files have been changed, then the UID may differ between driver and executor.
To avoid this, care needs to be taken to use images for the notebook and the Spark job that are using a common Spark build.

WARNING: When running a distributed Spark cluster from within a JupyterHub notebook, the notebook acts as the driver and requests executor Pods from k8s.
These Pods in turn can mount *all* volumes and Secrets in that namespace.
To prevent this from breaking user isolation, it is planned to use an OPA gatekeeper to define OPA rules that restrict what the created executor Pods can mount. This is not yet implemented in the demo nor reflected in this tutorial.

=== Overview

The notebook starts a distributed Spark cluster, which runs until the notebook kernel is stopped.
In order to connect to the S3 backend, the following settings must be configured in the Spark session:

[source, python]
----
    ...
    .config("spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.endpoint", "http://minio:9000/")
    .config("spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.path.style.access", "true")
    .config("spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.access.key", ...)
    .config("spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.secret.key", ...)
    .config("spark.hadoop.fs.s3a.aws.credentials.provider", "org.apache.hadoop.fs.s3a.SimpleAWSCredentialsProvider")
    .config("spark.jars.packages", "org.apache.hadoop:hadoop-client-api:3.3.4,org.apache.hadoop:hadoop-client-runtime:3.3.4,org.apache.hadoop:hadoop-aws:3.3.4,org.apache.hadoop:hadoop-common:3.3.4,com.amazonaws:aws-java-sdk-bundle:1.12.162")
     ...
----

Since the notebook image does not include any AWS or Hadoop libraries, these are listed under `spark.jars.packages`.
How these libraries are handled can be seen by looking at the logs for the user Pod and the executor Pods that are spawned when the Spark session is created.
In the notebook Pod (e.g. `jupyter-isla-williams---14730816`) we see that JupyterHub uses Ivy to fetch each library and resolve the dependencies:

[source, console]
----

	found org.apache.hadoop#hadoop-client-api;3.3.4 in central
	found org.xerial.snappy#snappy-java;1.1.8.2 in central
    ...
----

And in the executor, we see from the logs (simplified for clarity) that the user-specific driver service is used to provide these libraries.
The executor connects to the service and then iterates through the list of resolved dependencies, fetching each package to a temporary folder (`/var/data/spark-bfed3050-5f63-441d-9799-a196d7b54ce9/spark-a03b09a7-869e-4778-ac04-fa935bbca5ab`) before copying it to the working folder (`/opt/spark/work-dir`):

Once the Spark session has been created, the notebook reads data from S3, performs a simple aggregation and re-writes it in different formats. Further comments can be found in the notebook itself.
