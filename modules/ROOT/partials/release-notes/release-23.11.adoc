== Release 23.11

This release introduces two further elements of platform stability - pod disruption budgets and graceful shutdown specifications - as well as a new management tool and updated product version support.
Any known issues related to this release are listed in the <<KI_2311>> section below.

=== 23.11.0

Released 2023-11-30.

==== New / extended platform features

The following new major platform features were added:

===== PodDisruptionBudgets
Kubernetes has mechanisms to ensure minimal planned downtime.
Our product operators deploy so-called PodDisruptionBudget (PDB) resources alongside the products.
For every role that you specify (e.g. HDFS namenodes or Trino workers) a PDB is created.
This will determine the extent to which roles for a given application may be inactive at any given time.
See xref:concepts:operations/pod_disruptions.adoc[the documentation] for more details.

===== Graceful shutdown
Graceful shutdown refers to the managed, controlled shutdown of service instances in the manner intended by the software authors.
Typically, an instance will receive a signal indicating the intent for the server to shut down, and it will initiate a controlled shutdown.
Our operators configure a sensible amount of time Pods are granted to properly shut down without disrupting the availability of the product.
See xref:concepts:operations/graceful_shutdown.adoc[the documentation] for more details.

===== Signed SDP product images
As of this release all Stackable product images are signed (the signing of operator images was delivered in SDP 23.7).
Please see this xref:guides:enabling-verification-of-image-signatures.adoc[tutorial] for more information.

===== Airflow KubernetesExecutor
Airflow clusters can now be configured to use Kubernetes executors, whereby pods are spun up for job tasks and terminated when complete, thus offering an alternative way to use resources without the need for job queuing.

===== Overridable Java security settings
For JVM-based products (i.e. Druid, HBase, HDFS, Hive, Kafka, NiFi, Spark, Trino and ZooKeeper) it is now possible to provide custom security settings that override the default values.
This allows the user to control things such as DNS lookup caches.

===== Stackable Cockpit
This release includes a very early preview version of Stackable Cockpit, a browser-based management tool which interacts with the Stackable data platform to display e.g. deployed stacklets and their status.

===== stackablectl
Our command line tool has been re-worked to use the same backbone as Stackable Cockpit: you can find out about the recent enhancements by visiting the online xref:management:stackablectl:index.adoc[documentation].

===== Listener operator
The listener-operator was introduced in release 23.1 and the associated ServiceType field in 23.4.
In this release we introduce configurable ListenerClass _presets_ that map to the service types appropriate for different environments.
This is discussed in more detail in the xref:listener-operator:listenerclass.adoc[documentation].

===== Openshift certification
All Stackable operators in the 23.11 release have been certified for Openshift versions 4.11-4.13 and can be installed directly from the OperatorHub UI: image:openshift_operatorhub.png[OperatorHub in Openshift portal]

===== Product features

This link lists the xref:demos:index.adoc[available demos].

==== Supported Kubernetes versions

This release supports the following Kubernetes versions:

* `1.28`
* `1.27`
* `1.26`

These Kubernetes versions are no longer supported:

* `1.25`
* `1.24`

==== Supported OpenShift versions

This release supports the following OpenShift versions:

* `4.13`
* `4.12`
* `4.11`

==== Breaking changes

You will need to adapt your existing CRDs due to the following breaking changes detailed below.

NOTE: For all operators: the field `spec.image.stackableVersion` is no longer needed when the operator and product stackable versions match e.g. both are `23.11`. If this field has been _previously_ set this will *not* happen: in such cases `spec.image.stackableVersion` should be set explicitly, either to a release version or to `null`.

===== Stackable Operator for Apache Airflow

* https://github.com/stackabletech/airflow-operator/pull/322[Removed AirflowDB]: `.spec.clusterConfig.databaseInitialization` was removed from the CRD.
  This allowed configuring logging for the database initialization job, which does not exist anymore.
  Instead, database initialization is done by the scheduler pod, which has its own logging configuration.
  This was necessary to remove the `AirflowDB` Custom Resource, which caused problems when upgrading or reinstalling Airflow clusters.
  Additionally, the `AirflowDB` custom resource is not used anymore. Those CRs should be deleted.

* https://github.com/stackabletech/airflow-operator/pull/311[Implement KubernetesExecutor]: As an alternative to the CeleryExecutor we now also support the KubernetesExecutor, whereby pods are spun up for job tasks and are terminated afterwards.
  This removes the need for a Redis job queue and offers an alternative approach to resource management.

* https://github.com/stackabletech/airflow-operator/pull/316[Rename service port name]: The service port name has been renamed from airflow to http for consistency reasons.
  This change requires that the statefulset be removed before upgrading.
  There might also be some e.g. Ingresses that rely on the port name that will need to be updated.

* https://github.com/stackabletech/airflow-operator/pull/303[AuthenticationClass references]: `spec.clusterConfig.authenticationConfig` has been consolidated to `spec.clusterConfig.authentication` which takes a vector of AuthenticationClass references.

These consolidated changes would require a change from e.g.

===== Stackable Operator for Apache Kafka

https://github.com/stackabletech/kafka-operator/pull/621[Certificate conversion]: The secret-operator now handles certificate conversion.
This allows for the removal of the prepare init container but means that you can't configure the log level for this container anymore.
You will need to remove the field `spec.brokers.config.logging.container.prepare` in case it is specified.

===== Stackable Operator for Apache Superset

* https://github.com/stackabletech/superset-operator/pull/396[Remove SupersetDB]: `.spec.clusterConfig.loadExamplesOnInit` was removed from the CRD.
  Already loaded examples in Superset will not be removed by this change.
  Additionally, the `SupersetDB` custom resource is not used anymore.
  Those CRs should be deleted. Loading examples is still supported, the process is now described in the https://docs.stackable.tech/home/stable/superset/getting_started/first_steps[documentation].

* https://github.com/stackabletech/superset-operator/pull/394[Rename service port name]: The service port name has been renamed from superset to http for consistency reasons.
  This change requires that the statefulset be removed before upgrading.
  There might also be some e.g. Ingresses that rely on the port name that will need to be updated.

==== Upgrade from 23.7

===== Using stackablectl

To uninstall the `23.7` release run

[source,console]
----
$ stackablectl release uninstall 23.7
[INFO ] Uninstalling release 23.7
[INFO ] Uninstalling airflow operator
[INFO ] Uninstalling commons operator
# ...
----

Afterwards you will need to upgrade the CustomResourceDefinitions (CRDs) installed by the Stackable Platform.
The reason for this is that helm will uninstall the operators but not the CRDs. This can be done using `kubectl replace`:

===== Using helm

Use `helm list` to list the currently installed operators.

You can use the following command to uninstall all operators that are part of the `23.7` release:

[source,console]
----
$ helm uninstall airflow-operator commons-operator druid-operator hbase-operator hdfs-operator hive-operator kafka-operator listener-operator nifi-operator opa-operator secret-operator spark-k8s-operator superset-operator trino-operator zookeeper-operator
release "airflow-operator" uninstalled
release "commons-operator" uninstalled
# ...
----

Afterwards you will need to upgrade the CustomResourceDefinitions (CRDs) installed by the Stackable Platform.
The reason for this is that helm will uninstall the operators but not the CRDs. This can be done using `kubectl replace`:

[source,console]

===== Known upgrade issues

In the case of the breaking changes detailed above it will be necessary to update the custom resources and re-apply them.
Additionally, please note the following:

====== All operators

If the default PVC size has been changed, then the StatefulSet must be deleted: it is not possible to change the PVC in the StatefulSet specification.

==== Known issues [[KI_2311]]

https://github.com/stackabletech/spark-k8s-operator/pull/313[Spark-k8s: missing RBAC permission].
This has been fixed in the nightly build of the operator.
