= Export Control

== USA

The USA adopts the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Export_Administration_Regulations[Export Administration Regulations (EAR)] as the primary regulation to control exports.

All of our products are outside of the scope of EAR because they fall under the _publicly available_ exemption and do not contain non-standard cryptography.

NOTE: That means E-Mail notifications to the NSA and BIS are not required and are therefore not published here.

In particular:

* We are exempt under https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-15/subtitle-B/chapter-VII/subchapter-C/part-734/section-734.3[EAR 734.3(b)] because we publish according to https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-15/subtitle-B/chapter-VII/subchapter-C/part-734/section-734.7[EAR 734.7]
* We are exempt under https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-15/subtitle-B/chapter-VII/subchapter-C/part-742/section-742.15[EAR 742.15(b)] as our software includes only https://ecfr.io/Title-15/Section-772.1[standard encryption]
