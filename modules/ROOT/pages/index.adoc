<h3>Goal of the project</h3>
++++

We are building a distribution of existing Open Source tools that together comprise the components of a modern data platform.

There are components to ingest data, to store data, to process and visualize and much more.
While the platform got started in the _Big Data_ ecosystem we are in no way limited to big data workloads.

You can declaratively build these environments, and we don't stop at the tool level as we also provide ways for the users to interact with the platform in the "as Code"-approach.

We are leveraging the https://www.openpolicyagent.org/[Open Policy Agent] to provide Security-as-Code.

We are building a distribution that includes the “best of breed” of existing Open Source tools, but bundles them in a way, so it is easy to deploy a fully working stack of software. Most of the existing tools are “single purpose” tools, which often do not play nicely together out-of-the-box.
