= Stackable Documentation

Welcome to Stackable!
This documentation gives you an overview of the Stackable Data Platform, how to install and manage it as well as some tutorials.

If you have any feedback regarding the documentation please either open an https://github.com/stackabletech/documentation/issues[issue], ask a https://github.com/stackabletech/documentation/discussions[question] or look at the source for this documentation in its https://github.com/stackabletech/documentation[repository].

== Introduction

The Stackable Data Platform allows you to deploy, scale and manage Data infrastructure in any environment running https://kubernetes.io/[Kubernetes].


== Goal of the project

We are building a distribution of existing Open Source tools that together comprise the components of a modern data platform.

There are components to ingest data, to store data, to process and visualize and much more.
While the platform got started in the _Big Data_ ecosystem we are in no way limited to big data workloads.

You can declaratively build these environments, and we don't stop at the tool level as we also provide ways for the users to interact with the platform in the "as Code"-approach.

We are leveraging the https://www.openpolicyagent.org/[Open Policy Agent] to provide Security-as-Code.

We are building a distribution that includes the “best of breed” of existing Open Source tools, but bundles them in a way, so it is easy to deploy a fully working stack of software. Most of the existing tools are “single purpose” tools, which often do not play nicely together out-of-the-box.


== Components

We are using Kubernetes as our deployment platform.
And we're building https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/[Operators] for each of the products we support.

The Stackable Data Platform supports the following products:

- https://airflow.apache.org[Apache Airflow]
- https://druid.apache.org[Apache Druid]
- https://hbase.apache.org[Apache HBase]
- https://hadoop.apache.org[Apache Hadoop HDFS]
- https://hive.apache.org[Apache Hive Metastore]
- https://kafka.apache.org[Apache Kafka]
- https://nifi.apache.org[Apache NiFi]
- https://spark.apache.org[Apache Spark]
- https://superset.apache.org[Apache Superset]
- https://trino.io[Trino]
- https://zookeeper.apache.org[Apache ZooKeeper]


== Supported Kubernetes Versions

The Kubernetes project maintains release branches for the latest three versions, we follow this approach and also support the latest three kubernetes versions which are, at the moment:

include::partial$supported-kubernetes-versions.adoc[]

== Getting Started
Stackable provides a tutorial xref:getting_started.adoc[], which outlines how to deploy a Stackable cluster and the supported infrastructure. There is also a quickstart shell script in the https://github.com/stackabletech/stackable-utils[stackable-utils] GitHub repository that will quickly bootstrap an example cluster.
