= Huawei cloud

Huawei cloud uses a non-standard Kubelet state directory.
Therefore installing secret-operator and listener-operator on Huawei cloud requires a special treatment.
Please read on the xref:secret-operator:installation.adoc#_huawei_cloud[secret-operator installation guide] and the xref:listener-operator:installation.adoc#_huawei_cloud[listener-operator installation guide] for details.
