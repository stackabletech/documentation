Huawei Cloud uses a non-standard Kubelet state directory.
For this reason the secret-operator and listener-operator on Huawei Cloud require special handling.
Please refer to the xref:secret-operator:installation.adoc#_huawei_cloud[secret-operator installation guide] and the xref:listener-operator:installation.adoc#_huawei_cloud[listener-operator installation guide] for details.
