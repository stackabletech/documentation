= Microk8s

Microk8s uses a non-standard Kubelet state directory.
Therefore installing secret-operator and listener-operator on Microk8s requires a special treatment.
Please read on the xref:secret-operator:installation.adoc#_microk8s[secret-operator installation guide] and the xref:listener-operator:installation.adoc#_microk8s[listener-operator installation guide] for details.
