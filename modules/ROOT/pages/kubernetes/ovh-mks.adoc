= OVH Managed Kubernetes Service (MKS)

The Stackable Data Platform should install normally on the OVH MKS out of the box.

As with all cloud environments, we recommend configuring the xref:listener-operator:index.adoc[] to use the xref:listener-operator:listenerclass.adoc#preset-ephemeral-nodes[`ephemeral-nodes` preset]. Otherwise, Pods may fail to be rescheduled if their existing Nodes are deleted due to rescaling or rolling system upgrades.
