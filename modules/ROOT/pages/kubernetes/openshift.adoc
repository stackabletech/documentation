= OpenShift

SDP operators are certified for the OpenShift platform and can be installed from the OperatorHub.

IMPORTANT: OpenShift installations with FIPS mode enabled are not supported. This is because neither the SDP operators, nor the supported Apache products are FIPS-compliant.

== Customizing operator installations
Depending on the cluster size, you may need to customize the resources requested by the SDP operator Pods.
This is possible when installing the operators from the command line.
For example, to assign `256Mi` of memory to the Apache Kafka operator, you need to create a custom Subscription as follows:

[source,yaml]
----
---
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: stackable-kafka-operator
  namespace: stackable-operators
spec:
  channel: stable
  installPlanApproval: Automatic
  name: stackable-kafka-operator
  source: certified-operators
  sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace
  startingCSV: kafka-operator.v23.11.0
  config:
    resources:
      limits:
        memory: 256Mi
      requests:
        memory: 256Mi
----

In addition, You can restrict the operator to watch a specific namespace. By default, the operator watches all namespaces.
For example, to restrict the Kafka operator to watching only a namespace called `kafka-namespace` you add the following properties to the Subscription manifest:

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  config:
    env:
      - name: WATCH_NAMESPACE
        value: kafka-namespace
