= Release notes for the Stackable Data Platform
:page-aliases: release_notes.adoc

The Stackable platform consists of multiple operators that work together. Periodically a platform release is made,
including all components of the platform at a specific version.

== Release 23.11

This release introduces two further elements of platform stability - pod disruption budgets and graceful shutdown specifications - as well as a new management tool and updated product version support.

=== New / extended platform features

The following new major platform features were added:

PodDisruptionBudgets::
Kubernetes has mechanisms to ensure minimal planned downtime. Our product operators deploy so-called PodDisruptionBudget (PDB) resources alongside the products. For every role that you specify (e.g. HDFS namenodes or Trino workers) a PDB is created. This will determine the extent to which roles for a given application may be inactive at any given time. See xref:concepts:operations/pod_disruptions.adoc[the
documentation] for more details.

Graceful shutdown::
Graceful shutdown refers to the managed, controlled shutdown of service instances in the manner intended by the software authors. Typically, an instance will receive a signal indicating the intent for the server to shut down, and it will initiate a controlled shutdown. Our operators configure a sensible amount of time Pods are granted to properly shut down without disrupting the availability of the product. See xref:concepts:operations/graceful_shutdown.adoc[the
documentation] for more details.

Signed SDP product images::
As of this release all Stackable product images are signed (the signing of operator images was delivered in SDP 23.7). Please see this
xref:tutorials:enabling_verification_of_image_signatures.adoc[tutorial] for more information.

Airflow KubernetesExecutor::
Airflow clusters can now be configured to use Kubernetes executors, whereby pods are spun up for job tasks and terminated when complete, thus offering an alternative way to use resources without the need for job queuing.

Overridable Java security settings::
For JVM-based products (i.e. Druid, HBase, HDFS, Hive, Kafka, NiFi, Spark, Trino and ZooKeeper) it is now possible to provide custom security settings that override the default values. This allows the user to control things such as DNS lookup caches.

Stackable Cockpit::
This release includes a very early preview version of Stackable Cockpit, a browser-based management tool which interacts with the Stackable data platform to display e.g. deployed stacklets and their status.

stackablectl::
Our command line tool has been re-worked to use the same backbone as Stackable Cockpit: you can find out about the recent enhancements by visiting the online xref:management:stackablectl:index.adoc[documentation].

Listener operator::
The listener-operator was introduced in release 23.1 and the associated ServiceType field in 23.4. In this release we introduce configurable ListenerClass _presets_ that map to the service types appropriate for different environments. This is discussed in more detail in the xref:listener-operator:listenerclass.adoc[documentation].

Product features::

Additionally, there are some other individual product features that are noteworthy:

* https://github.com/stackabletech/docker-images/pull/494[HBase: support for Hadoop native compression]
* https://github.com/stackabletech/docker-images/pull/497[HBase: add operator tools to product image]

* https://github.com/stackabletech/trino-operator/pull/491[Trino: 428]
* https://github.com/stackabletech/zookeeper-operator/pull/732[ZooKeeper: 3.8.3]

==== Deprecated Versions

The following product versions are deprecated and will be removed in a later release:

* Airflow: 2.6.1
* HBase: 2.4.12

=== stackablectl

The following demo has been added to `stackablectl`:

==== Signal processing demo

This demonstrates the ingestion of streamed data into a Timescale time-series database, augmented by a moving window of anomaly detection measurements that are plotted alongside the raw data in Grafana.

This link lists the xref:demos:index.adoc[available demos].

=== Supported Kubernetes versions

This release supports the following Kubernetes versions:

* `1.28`
* `1.27`
* `1.26`

These Kubernetes versions are no longer supported:

* `1.25`
* `1.24`

=== Supported OpenShift versions

This release supports the following OpenShift versions:

* `4.13`
* `4.12`
* `4.11`

=== Breaking changes

You will need to adapt your existing CRDs due to the following breaking changes detailed below.

NOTE: For all operators: the field `spec.image.stackableVersion` is no longer needed when the operator and product stackable versions match e.g. both are `23.11`. If this field has been _previously_ set this will *not* happen: in such cases `spec.image.stackableVersion` should be set explicitly, either to a release version or to `null`.

==== Stackable Operator for Apache Airflow

* https://github.com/stackabletech/airflow-operator/pull/322[Removed AirflowDB] `.spec.clusterConfig.databaseInitialization` was removed from the CRD. This allowed configuring logging for the database initialization job, which does not exist anymore. Instead, database initialization is done by the scheduler pod, which has its own logging configuration. This was necessary to remove the `AirflowDB` Custom Resource, which caused problems when upgrading or reinstalling Airflow clusters.
Additionally, the `AirflowDB` custom resource is not used anymore. Those CRs should be deleted.

* https://github.com/stackabletech/airflow-operator/pull/311[Implement KubernetesExecutor] As an alternative to the CeleryExecutor we now also support the KubernetesExecutor, whereby pods are spun up for job tasks and are terminated afterwards. This removes the need for a Redis job queue and offers an alternative approach to resource management.

* https://github.com/stackabletech/airflow-operator/pull/316[Rename service port name] The service port name has been renamed from airflow to http for consistency reasons. This change requires that the statefulset be removed before upgrading. There might also be some e.g. Ingresses that rely on the port name that will need to be updated.

* https://github.com/stackabletech/airflow-operator/pull/303[AuthenticationClass references]
`spec.clusterConfig.authenticationConfig` has been consolidated to `spec.clusterConfig.authentication` which takes a vector of AuthenticationClass references.

These consolidated changes would require a change from e.g.

==== Stackable Operator for Apache Kafka

* https://github.com/stackabletech/kafka-operator/pull/621[Certificate conversion] The secret-operator now handles certificate conversion. This allows for the removal of the prepare init container but means that you can't configure the log level for this container anymore. You will need to remove the field `spec.brokers.config.logging.container.prepare` in case it is specified.

Already loaded examples in Superset will not be removed by this change. Additionally, the `SupersetDB` custom resource is not used anymore. Those CRs should be deleted. Loading examples is still supported, the process is now described in the https://docs.stackable.tech/home/stable/superset/getting_started/first_steps[documentation].

* https://github.com/stackabletech/superset-operator/pull/394[Rename service port name]
 The service port name has been renamed from superset to http for consistency reasons. This change requires that the statefulset be removed before upgrading. There might also be some e.g. Ingresses that rely on the port name that will need to be updated.

==== Using helm
Use `helm list` to list the currently installed operators.

You can use the following command to uninstall all operators that are part of the `23.7` release:

[source,console]
----
$ helm uninstall airflow-operator commons-operator druid-operator hbase-operator hdfs-operator hive-operator kafka-operator listener-operator nifi-operator opa-operator secret-operator spark-k8s-operator superset-operator trino-operator zookeeper-operator
release "airflow-operator" uninstalled
release "commons-operator" uninstalled
# ...
----

Afterwards you will need to upgrade the CustomResourceDefinitions (CRDs) installed by the Stackable Platform.
The reason for this is that helm will uninstall the operators but not the CRDs. This can be done using `kubectl replace`:

[source,console]
----
kubectl replace -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stackabletech/airflow-operator/23.11.0/deploy/helm/airflow-operator/crds/crds.yaml

==== Known upgrade issues

In the case of the breaking changes detailed above it will be necessary to update the custom resources and re-apply them.

Additionally, please note the following:

===== All operators

* If the default PVC size has been changed, then the StatefulSet must be deleted: it is not possible to change the PVC
in the StatefulSet specification.

== Release 23.7

This release introduces the specification of resource quotas and pod overrides and updates the product versions
supported by SDP.

=== New / extended platform features

The following new major platform features were added:

Resource Quotas::

Explicit resources are now applied to all containers, for both operators and products. This allows running the Stackable
Data Platform on Kubernetes clusters with a ResourceQuota or LimitRange set. Where these are not specified directly,
defaults will be used. See https://github.com/stackabletech/issues/issues/368[this issue] for more information.

Pod Overrides::

It is now possible to add custom settings which specify elements of a pod template (Service, StatefulSet etc.) on roles
or rolegroups, which the operator then merges with the objects it writes before actually applying them. This provides
the user with a possibility for specifying any property that can be set on a regular Kubernetes Pod, but which is not
directly exposed via the Stackable custom resource definition. Have a look at xref:concepts:overrides.adoc[the
documentation] for more details.

For example, with HDFS:

```
    roleGroups:
      default:
        replicas: 1
        podOverrides:
          spec:
            containers:
              - name: journalnode
                resources:
                  requests:
                    cpu: 110m
                  limits:
                    cpu: 410m
```

Openshift certification::

OLM bundles - a pre-requisite for the Openshift certification process - have been created for each operator. All 15 SDP
operators in release 23.4.1 are now Openshift-certified and deployable directly from within an Openshift cluster.

Signed SDP operator images::

As of this release all Stackable operator images are signed (this feature will be added to product images in a
subsequent release). More information about this, including how to verify the image signatures, can be found in this
xref:tutorials:enabling_verification_of_image_signatures.adoc[tutorial].

=== Breaking changes

The re-structuring of configuration definitions in certain operators will require you to adapt your existing CRDs as
shown below.

==== Stackable Operator for Apache Airflow

* https://github.com/stackabletech/airflow-operator/issues/271[Consolidated remaining top level configuration to
  clusterConfig]

CRDs should be changed from e.g.

```
spec:
  ...
  executor: CeleryExecutor
  loadExamples: true
  exposeConfig: false
  credentialsSecret: test-airflow-credentials
  ...
```

to:

```
spec:
  ...
  clusterConfig:
    executor: CeleryExecutor
    loadExamples: true
    exposeConfig: false
    credentialsSecret: test-airflow-credentials
    ...
```

==== Stackable Operator for Apache Superset

* https://github.com/stackabletech/superset-operator/issues/379[Moved all top level config options to clusterConfig.
  Authentication is now provided via an array of AuthenticationClasses and additional properties]

CRDs should be changed from e.g.

```
spec:
  ...
  credentialsSecret: superset-credentials
  loadExamplesOnInit: false
  vectorAggregatorConfigMapName: vector-aggregator-discovery
  ...
```

to:

```
spec:
  ...
  clusterConfig:
    credentialsSecret: superset-credentials
    loadExamplesOnInit: false
    vectorAggregatorConfigMapName: vector-aggregator-discovery
    ...
```

==== Stackable Operator for Trino

* https://github.com/stackabletech/trino-operator/issues/434[Reworked authentication mechanism: The
  `clusterConfig.authentication` now requires a list of AuthenticationClass references instead of the MultiUser and
  LDAP separation]

CRDs should be changed from e.g.

```
spec:
  ...
  clusterConfig:
    authentication:
      method:
        multiUser:
          userCredentialsSecret:
            name: trino-users
  ...
```

referencing a Secret with bcrypt-ed data:

```
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: trino-users
type: kubernetes.io/opaque
stringData:
  # admin:admin
  admin: $2y$10$89xReovvDLacVzRGpjOyAOONnayOgDAyIS2nW9bs5DJT98q17Dy5i
  # alice:alice
  alice: $2y$10$HcCa4k9v2DRrD/g7e5vEz.Bk.1xg00YTEHOZjPX7oK3KqMSt2xT8W
  # bob:bob
  bob: $2y$10$xVRXtYZnYuQu66SmruijPO8WHFM/UK5QPHTr.Nzf4JMcZSqt3W.2.
```

to:

```
spec:
  ...
  clusterConfig:
    authentication:
      - authenticationClass: trino-users-auth
    ...
```

referencing an AuthenticationClass (which references a Secret with plain data):

```
---
apiVersion: authentication.stackable.tech/v1alpha1
kind: AuthenticationClass
metadata:
    name: trino-users-auth
spec:
  provider:
    static:
      userCredentialsSecret:
        name: trino-users
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: trino-users
type: kubernetes.io/opaque
stringData:
  admin: admin
  alice: alice
  bob: bob
```

==== Known upgrade issues

In the case of the breaking changes detailed above it will be necessary to update the custom resources for Airflow,
Superset and Trino clusters and re-apply them.

Additionally, please note the following:

===== All operators

* If the default PVC size has been changed, then the StatefulSet must be deleted: it is not possible to change the PVC
  in the StatefulSet specification.
** The error message is similar to: `StatefulSet.apps "trino-worker-default" is invalid: spec: Forbidden: updates to
   `StatefulSet` spec for fields other than 'replicas', 'template', 'updateStrategy', [...]`

===== ZooKeeper operator

* The ZooKeeper operator in this release expects a product image with the same version. An existing ZooKeeper cluster
  resource should be deleted and re-applied with the corresponding `stackableVersion` e.g.:

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  image:
    productVersion: 3.8.0
    stackableVersion: "23.7"
----

== Release 23.4

The focus in this platform release is on the support of default/custom affinities and the status field, as well as the
rollout of log aggregation across the remaining operators. Additionally, all operators have been updated and tested for
compatibility with OpenShift clusters (versions 4.10 and 4.11). Several operators from the 23.1 platform release were
already certified against OpenShift.

=== Release 23.4.0

This was the first release in the 23.4 release line. It is recommended to install <<Release 23.4.1>> instead, as it
contains relevant bugfixes.

=== Release 23.4.1

This is a bugfix/patch-level release that fixes the following issues:

* Fix missing custom resource defaults that are required for a release update. See
  https://github.com/stackabletech/issues/issues/388[here].
* Specify the security context to run as a member of the root group (this has been implemented for the Stackable
  operators where it had not previously been implemented i.e. Apache HBase, Apache HDFS, Apache ZooKeeper and Apache
  Spark on Kubernetes). This is required by Openshift clusters so that the product can be run with a random UID. This is
  a https://airflow.apache.org/docs/docker-stack/entrypoint.html#allowing-arbitrary-user-to-run-the-container[requirement]
  for at least Airflow, but is Openshift policy as described https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.11/openshift_images/create-images.html#images-create-guide-openshift_create-images[here]
  and https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/10/26/adapting-docker-and-kubernetes-containers-to-run-on-red-hat-openshift-container-platform[here].
* Automatically migrate the name used for the bundle-builder container for OPA daemonsets. See
  https://github.com/stackabletech/opa-operator/issues/444[here].
* Automatically shorten the registration socket path used in listener-operator for Microk8s compatibility, migrated
  during upgrade. See https://github.com/stackabletech/listener-operator/issues/76[here].

=== New / extended platform features
The following new major platform features were added:

Cluster Operation::

The first part of xref:concepts:operations/cluster_operations.adoc[Cluster operations] was rolled out in every applicable Stackable
Operator. This supports pausing the cluster reconciliation and stopping the cluster completely. Pausing reconciliation
will not apply any changes to the Kubernetes resources (e.g. when changing the custom resource). Stopping the cluster
will set all replicas of StatefulSets, Deployments or DaemonSets to zero and therefore result in the deletion of all Pods
belonging to that cluster (not the PVCs)

Status Field::

Operators of the Stackable Data Platform create, manage and delete Kubernetes resources: in order to easily query the
health state of the products - and react accordingly - Stackable Operators use several predefined condition types to
capture different aspects of a product's availability. See this xref:contributor:adr/ADR027-status[ADR] for more
information.

Default / Custom Affinities::

In Kubernetes there are different ways to influence how Pods are assigned to Nodes. In some cases it makes sense to
co-locate certain services that communicate a lot with each other, such as HBase regionservers with HDFS datanodes. In
other cases it makes sense to distribute the Pods among as many Nodes as possible. There may also be additional
requirements e.g. placing important services - such as HDFS namenodes - in different racks, datacenter rooms or even
datacenters. This release implements default affinities that should suffice for many scenarios out-of-the box, while
also allowing for custom affinity rules at a role and/or role-group level. See this
xref:contributor:adr/ADR026-affinities.adoc[ADR] for more information.

Log Aggregation::

The logging framework (added to the platform in Release 23.1) offers a consistent custom resource configuration and a
separate, persisted sink (defaulting to OpenSearch). This has now been rolled out across all products. See this
xref:contributor:adr/adr025-logging_architecture[ADR] and this xref:concepts:logging.adoc[concepts page] for more
information.

Service Type::

The Service type can now be specified in all products. This currently differentiates between the internal ClusterIP and
the external NodePort and is forward compatible with the xref:listener-operator:listenerclass.adoc[ListenerClass] for
the automatic exposure of Services via the Listener Operator. This change is not backwards compatible with older
platform releases. For security reasons, the default is set to the cluster-internal (ClusterIP) ListenerClass. A cluster
can be exposed outside of Kubernetes by setting clusterConfig.listenerClass to external-unstable (NodePort) or
external-stable (LoadBalancer).

New Versions::

No new product versions are supported in this platform release.

Deprecated Versions::

No product versions have been deprecated in this platform release.

Product features::

Additionally, there are some individual product features that are noteworthy:

* https://github.com/stackabletech/airflow-operator/issues/177[Apache Airflow: load DAGs per git-sync]
* https://github.com/stackabletech/hdfs-operator/issues/289[Apache HDFS: Rework HDFS TLS / Auth structs]
* https://github.com/stackabletech/trino-operator/issues/395[Trino: Rework HDFS TLS / Auth structs]
* https://github.com/stackabletech/secret-operator/pull/252[Secret operator: support running the Secret operator in unprivileged mode ]
* https://github.com/stackabletech/secret-operator/pull/235[Secret operator: allow configuring CSI docker images]
* https://github.com/stackabletech/secret-operator/issues/4[Secret operator: Kerberos keytab provisioning]

=== stackablectl

The following have been added to `stackablectl`:

==== Trino-iceberg demo

This is a condensed form of the xref:demos:data-lakehouse-iceberg-trino-spark.adoc[] demo focusing on using the
lakehouse to store and modify data. It demonstrates how to integrate Trino and Iceberg and should run on a local
workstation.

==== Jupyterhub/Spark demo

This demo showcases the integration between Jupyter and Apache Hadoop deployed on the Stackable Data Platform (SDP)
Kubernetes cluster. This demo can be installed on most cloud managed Kubernetes clusters as well as on premise or on a
reasonably provisioned laptop.


The xref:management:stackablectl:quickstart.adoc[quickstart guide] shows how to get started with `stackablectl`. This
link lists the xref:demos:index.adoc[available demos].


=== Supported Kubernetes versions

This release supports the following Kubernetes versions:

* `1.26`
* `1.25`
* `1.24`
* `1.23` (it is planned to discontinue support for this version in the next release)

=== Supported OpenShift versions

This release supports the following OpenShift versions:

* `4.11`
* `4.10`

=== Breaking changes

You will need to adapt your existing CRDs due to the following breaking changes detailed below.

==== All Stackable Operators

As mentioned above, specifying the service type is a breaking change for all operators. The default value is set to the
`cluster-internal` `ListenerClass`: if the cluster requires external access outside of Kubernetes then set
`clusterConfig.listenerClass` to `external-unstable` or `external-stable`:

```
spec:
  image:
    productVersion: "396"
    stackableVersion: "23.4.1"
  clusterConfig:
    listenerClass: external-unstable
```
This is an example for Trino, but the pattern is the same across all operators.

==== Stackable Operator for Apache Airflow

Existing Airflow clusters need to be deleted and recreated. Airflow metadata held in the database and DAGs saved on disk
are not affected.

This is required because the UID of the Airflow user has
https://github.com/stackabletech/airflow-operator/pull/219[changed] to be in line with the rest of the platform.

==== Stackable Operator for Apache HBase

* https://github.com/stackabletech/hbase-operator/issues/329[Consolidated top level configuration to clusterConfig]

CRDs should be changed from e.g.

```
spec:
  ...
  hdfsConfigMapName: simple-hdfs
  zookeeperConfigMapName: simple-znode
```

to:

```
spec:
  ...
  clusterConfig:
    hdfsConfigMapName: simple-hdfs
    zookeeperConfigMapName: simple-znode
```

==== Stackable Operator for Apache Hadoop

* https://github.com/stackabletech/hdfs-operator/issues/289[Consolidated top level configuration to clusterConfig]

CRDs should be changed from e.g.

```
spec:
  ...
  zookeeperConfigMapName: simple-hdfs-znode
  dfsReplication: 3
  vectorAggregatorConfigMapName: vector-aggregator-discovery
```

to:

```
spec:
  ...
  clusterConfig:
    zookeeperConfigMapName: simple-hdfs-znode
    dfsReplication: 1
    vectorAggregatorConfigMapName: vector-aggregator-discovery
```

==== Stackable Operator for Apache Nifi

* https://github.com/stackabletech/nifi-operator/pull/417[Consolidated top level configuration to clusterConfig]

CRDs should be changed from e.g.

```
spec:
  ...
  zookeeperConfigMapName: simple-nifi-znode
```

to:

```
spec:
  ...
  clusterConfig:
    zookeeperConfigMapName: simple-nifi-znode
```

==== Stackable Operator for Apache Spark-k8s

* Support has been dropped for the use of the `spec.{driver,executor}.nodeSelector` field. Use `spec.{driver,executor}.affinity.nodeSelector` instead - this is part of https://github.com/stackabletech/issues/issues/323[Deploy default and support custom affinities in our operators]

CRDs should be changed from e.g.

```
spec:
  ...
  driver:
    nodeSelector:
```

to:

```
spec:
  ...
  driver:
    affinity:
```

==== Stackable Operator for Apache Trino

* https://github.com/stackabletech/trino-operator/issues/395[Consolidated top level configuration to clusterConfig]

CRDs should be changed from e.g.

```
spec:
  ...
  opa:
    configMapName: simple-opa
    package: trino
  authentication:
    method:
      multiUser:
        userCredentialsSecret:
          name: simple-trino-users-secret
  catalogLabelSelector:
    matchLabels:
      trino: simple-trino
  vectorAggregatorConfigMapName: vector-aggregator-discovery
```

to:

```
spec:
  ...
  clusterConfig:
    authentication:
      method:
        multiUser:
          userCredentialsSecret:
            name: simple-trino-users-secret
    authorization:
      opa:
        configMapName: simple-opa
        package: trino
    catalogLabelSelector:
      matchLabels:
        trino: simple-trino
    vectorAggregatorConfigMapName: vector-aggregator-discovery
```

== Release 23.1

This release marks a major change in the way operator and product images are versioned. Up until now, operators were versioned independently of each other and a platform release was a loosely coupled set of operator versions. This had major disadvantages both technical and organisational.

On the technical side, a multi-dimensional matrix of versions had to be tested, documentation cross-references had to be maintained and coordinating a platform release was extremely difficult.

Organizationally the biggest challenge was communication and coordination within the teams as well as to and with users.
As a result, starting with this release, all operator and product images are versioned in lock-step. This platform release is marked `23.1` and all included components are tagged with `23.1.0`. Eventual patch versions of the components that might follow and will be tagged with `23.1.1`, `23.1.2` and so on.

The focus in this platform release is on the support of offline (or on-premise) product images and the partial rollout of logging support.

=== New platform features
The following new major platform features were added:

Product image selection::
Product image selection has been expanded to cover different scenarios:

* Stackable-provided product images, defined with the repository, the product version and the stackable tag
* As above, but without the stackable tag (whereby the most recent tagged image will be taken)
* The product version and a full repository path (this allows fully-customized product images)

These options are described in more detail xref:contributor:adr/ADR023-product-image-selection.adoc[in this ADR] and on xref:concepts:product_image_selection.adoc[this concepts page].

*N.B.* this is a breaking change across all operators as `spec.version` has been replaced by `spec.image`.

Logging Aggregation::

Component activity within the platform is logged in a way that makes it difficult to find, persist and consolidate this information. Log configuration is also a challenge. To address these two issues a logging framework has been added to the platform, offering a consistent custom resource configuration and a separate, persisted sink (the current implementation support OpenSearch). This is discussed in more detail xref:contributor:adr/ADR025-logging_architecture.adoc[in this ADR] and xref:concepts:logging.adoc[on this concepts page].

In this release this has been added to the following components:

* https://github.com/stackabletech/hbase-operator/pull/294[Apache HBase]
* https://github.com/stackabletech/hdfs-operator/pull/290[Apache Hadoop]
* https://github.com/stackabletech/zookeeper-operator/pull/588[Apache Zookeeper]

Support for other products will be added in future releases.

New Versions::

The following new product version is now supported:

* https://github.com/stackabletech/trino-operator/pull/358[Trino 403]

Deprecated Versions::

The following product version is no longer supported:

* https://github.com/stackabletech/druid-operator/pull/339[Druid 0.22.1]

Product features::

Additionally, there are some individual product features that are noteworthy

* https://github.com/stackabletech/druid-operator/pull/342[The Druid segment cache size is configurable]
* https://github.com/stackabletech/druid-operator/pull/333[Druid support for TLS encryption and authentication]
* https://github.com/stackabletech/hdfs-operator/pull/296[HDFS support for multiple storage directories]
* https://github.com/stackabletech/spark-k8s-operator/pull/187[Support for Spark History Server]
* https://github.com/stackabletech/trino-operator/pull/337[Trino support for Google Sheets connector]
* https://github.com/stackabletech/trino-operator/pull/347[Trino support for Black Hole connector]

=== stackablectl

The following have been added to `stackablectl`:

==== Logging demo

This illustrates how to set up logging for Zookeeper and browse the results in an Open Search dashboard. This has been
implemented for HBase, Hadoop and Zookeeper and will eventually be available for all Stackable operators.

==== LDAP stack and tutorial

LDAP support has now been added to multiple products. An explanation of the overall approach is given
xref:concepts:authentication.adoc[here] but in order to make the configuration steps a little clearer a
xref:tutorials:authentication_with_openldap.adoc[tutorial] has been added that uses a dedicated Stackable
xref:management:stackablectl:commands/stack.adoc[stack] for OpenLDAP and shows its usage.

The xref:management:stackablectl:quickstart.adoc[quickstart guide] shows how to get started with `stackablectl`. This
link lists the xref:demos:index.adoc[available demos].

=== Supported Kubernetes versions

This release supports the following Kubernetes versions:

* `1.25`
* `1.24`
* `1.23`
* `1.22`

=== Breaking changes

This release brings with it several breaking changes needed to future-proof the platform. You will need to adapt your
existing CRDs due to the following breaking changes:

==== All Stackable Operators

As mentioned above, product image selection is a breaking for all operators. Previously the product image was declared
using `spec.version`:

```
spec:
  version: 396-stackable23.1
```
(example for Trino)

This must now be replaced with `spec.image`:

```
spec:
  image:
    productVersion: 396
    stackableVersion: 23.1
```

This is the same pattern across operators. so for Hive the change would look like this. From:

```
spec:
  version: 3.1.3-stackable23.1
```

to

```
spec:
  image:
    productVersion: 3.1.3
    stackableVersion: 23.1
```

==== Stackable Operator for Apache Druid

* https://github.com/stackabletech/druid-operator/pull/358[Tools image replaced with Druid image]

This means a stackable version >= 23.1 has to be used for the product image.

* https://github.com/stackabletech/druid-operator/pull/333[Reworked top level configuration to support TLS changes]

Deep storage, Ingestion spec, discovery config maps, authentication etc. are now subfields of spec.clusterConfig instead
of being top level under spec. Change the resource from e.g.:

```
  zookeeperConfigMapName: simple-druid-znode
  metadataStorageDatabase:
    dbType: derby
    connString: jdbc:derby://localhost:1527/var/druid/metadata.db;create=true
    host: localhost
    port: 1527
  deepStorage:
    hdfs:
      configMapName: simple-hdfs
      directory: /data
```
to
```
  clusterConfig:
    deepStorage:
      hdfs:
        configMapName: simple-hdfs
        directory: /data
    metadataStorageDatabase:
      dbType: derby
      connString: jdbc:derby://localhost:1527/var/druid/metadata.db;create=true
      host: localhost
      port: 1527
    tls: null
    zookeeperConfigMapName: simple-druid-znode
```

==== Stackable Operator for Apache Hadoop

* https://github.com/stackabletech/hdfs-operator/issues/290[Enable Log Aggregation for HDFS]

As part of the change mentioned above we also did some code cleanup that allowed us to remove arbitrary hard-coded
values from the operator. This change affects the directory structure the operator creates inside of the
`PersistentVolumes` used for permanent storage.

The old folder naming was:

 - DataNode -> `data`
 - JournalNode -> `journal`
 - NameNode -> `name`

which has now been adopted to match the actual rolename:

- DataNode -> `datanode`
- JournalNode -> `journalnode`
- NameNode -> `namenode`


Unfortunately, this means that for cluster that where initially rolled out with an older operator version, a one-time
migration step becomes necessary to rename these directories.

You can either do this manually by attaching the PVs to a pod and performing the rename (cluster needs to be stopped for
this) or use the script provided below.

WARNING: Please be aware that if this script runs after the cluster was already restarted with the newer operator
version it will delete any data that was written to the empty post-upgrade HDFS that was stood up by the new operator.

[source,bash]
----
include::example$code/migrate-hdfs-23_1.sh[]
----

The migration process for this now becomes:

* Stop HDFS cluster by either removing the HdfsCluster definition object or scaling all roles to 0 replicas
* Uninstall Stackable Operator for Apache Hadoop
* Run migration script
* Install newer version of Stackable Operator for Apache Hadoop

==== Stackable Operator for Apache Hive

* https://github.com/stackabletech/hive-operator/pull/292[Moved database specification from role/role-group level to top-level clusterConfig]
* https://github.com/stackabletech/hive-operator/pull/292[Moved s3, serviceType and hdfs discovery to top-level clusterConfig]

These two changes mean that resources previously defined like this:
```
  s3:
    reference: minio
  metastore:
    roleGroups:
      default:
        replicas: 1
        config:
          database:
            connString: jdbc:postgresql://hive-postgresql:5432/hive
            user: hive
            password: hive
            dbType: postgres
```
will now be defined like this:
```
  clusterConfig:
    database:
      connString: jdbc:postgresql://hive-postgresql:5432/hive
      user: hive
      password: hive
      dbType: postgres
    s3:
      reference: minio
  metastore:
    roleGroups:
      default:
        replicas: 1
```

==== Stackable Operator for Apache Kafka

* https://github.com/stackabletech/kafka-operator/pull/527[Remove the tools image and add kcat to the product image]

This means a stackable version >= 23.1 has to be used for the product image.

* https://github.com/stackabletech/kafka-operator/pull/532[Consolidate TLS encryption and authentication]

==== Stackable Operator for Apache Nifi

* https://github.com/stackabletech/nifi-operator/pull/397[Removed tools image]

This means a stackable version >= 23.1 has to be used for the product image.

==== Stackable Operator for Trino

* https://github.com/stackabletech/trino-operator/pull/357[Removed tools image]

This means a stackable version >= 23.1 has to be used for the product image.

* https://github.com/stackabletech/trino-operator/pull/362[Use user and password Secret keys for LDAP bind credentials
  Secrets, instead of env var names]

This changes the secret definition from:
```
stringData:
  LDAP_USER: cn=admin,dc=example,dc=org
  LDAP_PASSWORD: admin
```
to:
```
stringData:
  user: cn=admin,dc=example,dc=org
  password: admin
```


==== Stackable Operator for Apache Zookeeper
* https://github.com/stackabletech/zookeeper-operator/pull/612[Consolidate config]

Similar to the Kafka example above, the configuration settings are consolidated under `.spec` i.e. from:
```
  config:
    tls:
      secretClass: tls
    clientAuthentication:
      authenticationClass: zk-client-tls
    quorumTlsSecretClass: tls
```
to:
```
  clusterConfig:
    authentication:
      - authenticationClass: zk-client-tls
    tls:
      serverSecretClass: tls
      quorumSecretClass: tls
```

=== Upgrade from 22.11

==== Using stackablectl
You can list the available releases as follows

[source,console]
----
$ stackablectl release list
RELEASE            RELEASE DATE   DESCRIPTION
23.1               2023-01-27     Fourth release focusing on image selection and logging

[source,console]
----
$ stackablectl release uninstall 22.11

== Release 22.11
This is the third release of the Stackable Data Platform, which this time focuses on resource management.

=== New platform features
The following new major platform features were added:

CPU and memory limits configurable::
The operators now https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/[request] resources from Kubernetes for the products and required CPU and memory can now also be configured for all products. If your product instances are less performant after the update, the new defaults might be set too low and we recommend to xref:kafka:usage-guide/storage-resources.adoc[set custom requests] for your cluster.

=== Breaking changes
You will need to adapt your existing CRDs due to the following breaking changes:

==== Stackable Operator for Apache Spark
The configuration of pod resource requests has been changed to be consistent with other operators that are part of the Stackable Data Platform (https://github.com/stackabletech/spark-k8s-operator/pull/147[#174]).

In the previous version, these were configured like this:

```
  driver:
    cores: 1
    coreLimit: "1200m"
    memory: "512m"`
```

From now on, Pod resources can be configured in two different ways. The first and recommended way is to add a resources section for each role as the following examples shows:

```
  driver:
    resources:
      cpu:
        min: "1"
        max: "1500m"
      memory:
        limit: "1Gi"
```

The second method is to use the `sparkConf` section and and set them individually as spark properties:

```
  sparkConf:
    spark.kubernetes.submission.waitAppCompletion: "false"
    spark.kubernetes.driver.pod.name: "resources-sparkconf-driver"
    spark.kubernetes.executor.podNamePrefix: "resources-sparkconf"
    spark.kubernetes.driver.request.cores: "2"
    spark.kubernetes.driver.limit.cores: "3"
```

When both methods are used, the settings in the `sparkConf` section override the `resources` configuration.

Note that none of the settings above have any influence over the parallelism used by Spark itself. The only supported way to affect this is as follows:

```
  sparkConf:
    spark.driver.cores: "3"
    spark.executor.cores: "3"
```

== Release 22.09
This is the second release of the Stackable Data Platform.
It contains lots of new features and bugfixes.
The main features focus on OpenShift support and security.

=== New platform features
The following new major platform features were added:

OpenShift compatibility::
We have made continued progress towards OpenShift compability, and the following operators can now be previewed on OpenShift.
Further improvements are expected in future releases, but no stability or compatibility guarantees are currently made for OpenShift clusters.

* https://github.com/stackabletech/airflow-operator/pull/127[Apache Airflow]
* https://github.com/stackabletech/hbase-operator/pull/232[Apache HBase]
* https://github.com/stackabletech/hdfs-operator/pull/225[Apache HDFS]
* https://github.com/stackabletech/spark-k8s-operator/pull/126[Apache Spark on K8s]

Support for internal and external TLS::
The following operators support operating the products at a maximal level of transport security by using TLS certificates to secure internal and external communication:

* https://github.com/stackabletech/trino-operator/pull/244[Trino]
* https://github.com/stackabletech/kafka-operator/pull/442[Apache Kafka]
* https://github.com/stackabletech/zookeeper-operator/pull/479[Apache ZooKeeper]

LDAP authentication::
Use a central LDAP server to manage all of your user identities in a single place.
The following operators added support for LDAP authentication:

* https://github.com/stackabletech/airflow-operator/pull/133[Apache Airflow]
* https://github.com/stackabletech/nifi-operator/pull/303[Apache NiFi]
* https://github.com/stackabletech/superset-operator/pull/180[Apache Superset]

=== stackablectl

`stackablectl` now supports deploying ready-to-use demos, which give an end-to-end demonstration of the usage of the
Stackable Data Platform. The xref:management:stackablectl:quickstart.adoc[quickstart guide] shows how to get started
with `stackablectl`. Here you can see the xref:demos:index.adoc[available demos].

=== Supported Kubernetes versions
This release supports the following Kubernetes versions:

* `1.24`
* `1.23`
* `1.22`

Support for `1.21` was dropped.

=== Upgrade from 22.06

==== Using helm
Use `helm list` to list the currently installed operators.

You can use the following command to uninstall all of the operators that are part of the release 22.06:

[source,console]
----
$ helm uninstall airflow-operator commons-operator druid-operator hbase-operator hdfs-operator hive-operator kafka-operator nifi-operator opa-operator secret-operator spark-k8s-operator superset-operator trino-operator zookeeper-operator
release "airflow-operator" uninstalled
release "commons-operator" uninstalled
# ...
----

Afterwards you will need to update the CustomResourceDefinitions (CRDs) installed by the Stackable Platform.
The reason is, that helm will uninstall the operators but not the CRDs.

=== Breaking changes

You will need to adapt your existing CRDs to the following breaking changes:

==== druid-operator
1. HDFS deep storage is now configurable via the HDFS discovery config map instead of a url to a HDFS name node (https://github.com/stackabletech/druid-operator/pull/262[#262]).
Instead of

[source,yaml]
----
  deepStorage:
    hdfs:
      storageDirectory: hdfs://druid-hdfs-namenode-default-0:8020/data
----

use

[source,yaml]
----
  deepStorage:
    hdfs:
      configMapName: druid-hdfs
      directory: /druid
----

==== kafka-operator
1. Add TLS encryption and authentication support for internal and client communications. This is breaking for clients because the cluster is secured per default, which results in a client port change (https://github.com/stackabletech/kafka-operator/pull/442[#442]).
If you don't want to use TLS to secure your Kafka cluster you can restore the old behavior by using the `tls` attribute as follows:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: kafka.stackable.tech/v1alpha1
kind: KafkaCluster
# ...
spec:
  config:
    tls: null
  # ...
----

==== trino-operator
1. TrinoCatalogs now have their own CRD object and get referenced by the TrinoCluster (https://github.com/stackabletech/trino-operator/pull/263[#263]).
Instead of

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: trino.stackable.tech/v1alpha1
kind: TrinoCluster
# ...
spec:
  hiveConfigMapName: hive
  s3:
    inline:
      host: minio
      port: 9000
      accessStyle: Path
      credentials:
        secretClass: s3-credentials
  # ...
----

== Release 22.06

This is our first release of the Stackable Data Platform, bringing Kubernetes operators for 12 products as well as <<stackablectl>>, the commandline tool to easily install data products in Kubernetes.
Operators spin up production ready product applications.
Also, there are some common features across all operators, such as monitoring, service discovery and configuration overrides.
Find the <<Platform features>>, <<stackablectl,stackablectl features>> and <<operators>> below.

Please report any issues you find in the specific operator repositories or in our dedicated github.com/stackabletech/issues/[issues] repository.
You may also join us in our https://slack.stackable.tech[Slack] community or https://stackable.tech[contact us via our homepage].

While we are very proud of this release it is our first one and we'll add new features and fix bugs all the time and will have regular releases from now on.

=== Platform features

Easily install production ready data applications::
Using a familiar declarative approach, users can easily install data applications such as Apache Kafka or Trino across multiple cloud Kubernetes providers or on their own data centers.
The installation process is fully automated while also providing the flexibility for the user to tune relevant aspects of each application.

Monitoring::
All products have monitoring with prometheus enabled.
//
xref:operators:monitoring.adoc[Learn more]

Service discovery::
Products on the Stackable platform use service discovery to easily interconnect with each other.
//
xref:concepts:service_discovery.adoc[Learn more]

Configuration overrides::
All operators support configuration overrides, these are documented in the specific operator documentation pages.

Common S3 configuration::
Many products support connecting to S3 to load and/or store data.
There is a common resource for S3 connections and buckets across all operators that can be reused.
//
xref:concepts:s3.adoc[Learn more]

Roles and role groups::
To support hybrid hardware clusters, the Stackable platform uses the concept of role groups.
Services and applications can be configured to maximize hardware efficiency.

Standardized::
Learn once reuse everywhere.
We use the same conventions in all our operators.
Configure your LDAP or S3 connections once and reuse them everywhere.
All our operators reuse the same CRD structure as well.

[#stackablectl]
=== stackablectl

xref:management:stackablectl:index.adoc[stackablectl] is used to install and interact with the operators, either
individually or with multiple at once.
