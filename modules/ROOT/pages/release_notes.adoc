= Release notes for the Stackable Data Platform

The Stackable platform consists of multiple operators that work together.
Periodically a platform release is made, including all components of the platform at a specific version.

== Release 22.11
This is the third release of the Stackable Data Platform, which this time focuses on resource management.

=== New platform features
The following new major platform features were added:

CPU and memory limits configurable::
The operators now https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/[request] resources from Kubernetes for the products and required CPU and memory can now also be configured for all products. If your product instances are less performant after the update, the new defaults might be set too low and we recommend to https://docs.stackable.tech/kafka/stable/usage.html#_resource_requests[set custom requests] for your cluster.

==== Using stackablectl
You can list the available releases as follows

[source,console]

22.11              2022-11-08     Third release focusing on resource management
22.09              2022-09-09     Second release focusing on security and OpenShift support
22.06              2022-06-30     First official release of the Stackable Data Platform

To uninstall the `22.09` release run

[source,console]
----
$ stackablectl release uninstall 22.09
[INFO ] Uninstalling release 22.09

# ...
----

Afterwards you will need to update the CustomResourceDefinitions (CRDs) installed by the Stackable Platform.
The reason for this is that helm will uninstall the operators but not the CRDs.

==== Using helm
Use `helm list` to list the currently installed operators.

You can use the following command to uninstall all of the operators that are part of the release 22.09:

[source,console]
----
$ helm uninstall airflow-operator commons-operator druid-operator hbase-operator hdfs-operator hive-operator kafka-operator nifi-operator opa-operator secret-operator spark-k8s-operator superset-operator trino-operator zookeeper-operator

release "commons-operator" uninstalled
# ...

Afterwards you will need to update the CustomResourceDefinitions (CRDs) installed by the Stackable Platform.
This is because helm will uninstall the operators but not the CRDs.

==== Breaking changes
You will need to adapt your existing CRDs due to the following breaking changes:

==== Stackable Operator for Apache Spark
The configuration of pod resource requests has been changed to be consistent with other operators that are part of the Stackable Data Platform (https://github.com/stackabletech/spark-k8s-operator/pull/147[#174]).

In the previous version, these were configured like this:

```
  driver:
    cores: 1
    coreLimit: "1200m"
    memory: "512m"`
```

From now on, Pod resources can be configured in two different ways. The first and recommended way is to add a resources section for each role as the following examples shows:

```
  driver:
    resources:
      cpu:
        min: "1"
        max: "1500m"
      memory:
        limit: "1Gi"
```

The second method is to use the `sparkConf` section and and set them individually as spark properties:

```
  sparkConf:
    spark.kubernetes.submission.waitAppCompletion: "false"
    spark.kubernetes.driver.pod.name: "resources-sparkconf-driver"
    spark.kubernetes.executor.podNamePrefix: "resources-sparkconf"
    spark.kubernetes.driver.request.cores: "2"
    spark.kubernetes.driver.limit.cores: "3"
```

When both methods are used, the settings in the `sparkConf` section override the `resources` configuration.

Note that none of the settings above have any influence over the parallelism used by Spark itself. The only supported way to affect this is as follows:

```
  sparkConf:
    spark.driver.cores: "3"
    spark.executor.cores: "3"
```

== Release 22.09
This is the second release of the Stackable Data Platform.
It contains lots of new features and bugfixes.
The main features focus on OpenShift support and security.

=== New platform features
The following new major platform features were added:

OpenShift compatibility::
We have made continued progress towards OpenShift compability, and the following operators can now be previewed on OpenShift.
Further improvements are expected in future releases, but no stability or compatibility guarantees are currently made for OpenShift clusters.

* https://github.com/stackabletech/airflow-operator/pull/127[Apache Airflow]
* https://github.com/stackabletech/hbase-operator/pull/232[Apache HBase]
* https://github.com/stackabletech/hdfs-operator/pull/225[Apache HDFS]
* https://github.com/stackabletech/spark-k8s-operator/pull/126[Apache Spark on K8s]

Support for internal and external TLS::
The following operators support operating the products at a maximal level of transport security by using TLS certificates to secure internal and external communication:

* https://github.com/stackabletech/trino-operator/pull/244[Trino]
* https://github.com/stackabletech/kafka-operator/pull/442[Apache Kafka]
* https://github.com/stackabletech/zookeeper-operator/pull/479[Apache ZooKeeper]

LDAP authentication::
Use a central LDAP server to manage all of your user identities in a single place.
The following operators added support for LDAP authentication:

* https://github.com/stackabletech/airflow-operator/pull/133[Apache Airflow]
* https://github.com/stackabletech/nifi-operator/pull/303[Apache NiFi]
* https://github.com/stackabletech/superset-operator/pull/180[Apache Superset]

=== stackablectl

`stackablectl` now supports deploying ready-to-use demos, which give an end-to-end demonstration of the usage of the Stackable Data Platform.
The xref:stackablectl::quickstart.adoc[quickstart guide] shows how to get started with `stackablectl`. Here you can see the xref:stackablectl::demos/index.adoc[available demos].

=== Supported Kubernetes versions
This release supports the following Kubernetes versions:

* `1.24`
* `1.23`
* `1.22`

Support for `1.21` was dropped.

=== Upgrade from 22.06

==== Breaking changes

You will need to adapt your existing CRDs to the following breaking changes:

==== druid-operator
1. HDFS deep storage is now configurable via the HDFS discovery config map instead of a url to a HDFS name node (https://github.com/stackabletech/druid-operator/pull/262[#262]).
Instead of

[source,yaml]
----
  deepStorage:
    hdfs:
      storageDirectory: hdfs://druid-hdfs-namenode-default-0:8020/data
----

use

[source,yaml]
----
  deepStorage:
    hdfs:
      configMapName: druid-hdfs
      directory: /druid
----

==== kafka-operator
1. Add TLS encryption and authentication support for internal and client communications. This is breaking for clients because the cluster is secured per default, which results in a client port change (https://github.com/stackabletech/kafka-operator/pull/442[#442]).
If you don't want to use TLS to secure your Kafka cluster you can restore the old behavior by using the `tls` attribute as follows:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: kafka.stackable.tech/v1alpha1
kind: KafkaCluster
# ...
spec:
  config:
    tls: null
  # ...
----

==== trino-operator
1. TrinoCatalogs now have their own CRD object and get referenced by the TrinoCluster (https://github.com/stackabletech/trino-operator/pull/263[#263]).
Instead of

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: trino.stackable.tech/v1alpha1

This is our first release of the Stackable Data Platform, bringing Kubernetes operators for 12 products as well as <<stackablectl>>, the commandline tool to easily install data products in Kubernetes.
Operators spin up production ready product applications.
Also, there are some common features across all operators, such as monitoring, service discovery and configuration overrides.
Find the <<Platform features>>, <<stackablectl,stackablectl features>> and <<operators>> below.

Please report any issues you find in the specific operator repositories or in our dedicated github.com/stackabletech/issues/[issues] repository.
You may also join us in our https://slack.stackable.tech[Slack] community or https://stackable.tech[contact us via our homepage].

While we are very proud of this release it is our first one and we'll add new features and fix bugs all the time and will have regular releases from now on.

=== Platform features

Easily install production ready data applications::
Using a familiar declarative approach, users can easily install data applications such as Apache Kafka or Trino across multiple cloud Kubernetes providers or on their own data centers.
The installation process is fully automated while also providing the flexibility for the user to tune relevant aspects of each application.

Monitoring::
All products have monitoring with prometheus enabled.
//
xref:operators:monitoring.adoc[Learn more]

Service discovery::
Products on the Stackable platform use service discovery to easily interconnect with each other.
//
xref:concepts:service_discovery.adoc[Learn more]

Configuration overrides::
All operators support configuration overrides, these are documented in the specific operator documentation pages.

Common S3 configuration::
Many products support connecting to S3 to load and/or store data.
There is a common resource for S3 connections and buckets across all operators that can be reused.
//
xref:concepts:s3.adoc[Learn more]

Roles and role groups::
To support hybrid hardware clusters, the Stackable platform uses the concept of role groups.
Services and applications can be configured to maximize hardware efficiency.

Standardized::
Learn once reuse everywhere.
We use the same conventions in all our operators.
Configure your LDAP or S3 connections once and reuse them everywhere.
All our operators reuse the same CRD structure as well.

[#stackablectl]
=== stackablectl

`stackablectl` is used to install and interact with the operators, either individually or with multiple at once.
