This is the super-short getting started guide that should enable you to get something up and running in less than three
minutes (excluding download times).

== Setup

Install `stackablectl`, the Stackable CLI utility.

On Linux (Windows and MacOS instructions below):

[source,console]
----
$ curl -L -o stackablectl https://github.com/stackabletech/stackable-cockpit/releases/latest/download/stackablectl-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
----

and mark it as executable:

[source,console]
----
$ chmod +x stackablectl
----

.Instruction for Windows and MacOS
[%collapsible]
====
Download `stackablectl-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu.exe` (for Windows) or `stackablectl-x86_64-apple-darwin` (Mac OS Intel) or
`stackablectl-aarch64-apple-darwin` (MacOS ARM) from the {cockpit-releases}[latest release] and save it as
`stackablectl`. For Windows, you can simply execute it. For MacOS mark it as executable:

[source,console]
----
$ chmod +x stackablectl
----

If you want to execute it from anywhere in your system, you need to add it to the system `PATH`.

NOTE: If macOS denies the execution of stackablectl go to `Settings` -> `Security & Privacy` -> `General`. Here you will
see a pop up asking if you want to allow access for `stackablectl`. You must allow access.

== Install the Taxi data demo

The xref:demos:trino-taxi-data.adoc[`trino-taxi-data`] Demo installs the latest Stackable platform release and a
visualization of https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page[New York City Taxi Data] using Trino and
Superset:

[source,console]
----
./stackablectl demo install trino-taxi-data
----

TIP: Learn more about this demo in the demo docs: xref:demos:trino-taxi-data.adoc[]

== Connect

To list the installed installed Stackable services run the following command:

[source,console]
----
./stackablectl services list --all-namespaces
----

It will output something like:
