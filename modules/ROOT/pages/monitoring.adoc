= Monitoring

Services managed by Stackable support monitoring via https://prometheus.io/[Prometheus].

== Prometheus Operator

Stackable does not currently provide Prometheus, instead we suggest using
https://prometheus-operator.dev/[Prometheus Operator].

=== Installing Prometheus

Prometheus Operator can be installed via the Helm chart `kube-prometheus-stack`, which includes
both the Operator, and a basic Prometheus configuration that should be sufficient for basic use.

[source,bash]
helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
helm upgrade prometheus prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack --install --version 31.0.0

When using the `kube-prometheus-stack` Helm chart (as above), an additional `ServiceMonitor` must be applied to
the Kubernetes cluster, which discovers services registered to the Kubernetes cluster:

[source,yaml]
----
include::example$monitoring-servicemonitor.yaml[]
----

=== Querying Prometheus

Prometheus should now be accessible inside of the Kubernetes cluster, and can be access can be forwarded using `kubectl`:

[source,bash]
kubectl port-forward svc/prometheus-kube-prometheus-prometheus 9090

Afterwards, we can go to http://localhost:9090/ to access the query UI.

== Existing Prometheus

An existing Prometheus installation can also be used to monitor Stackable services.

In this case, it should be configured to scrape Kubernetes `Service` objects with the label `prometheus.io/scrape: "true"`.
For more details, see their official documentation for
https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#kubernetes_sd_config[`<kubernetes_sd_config>`].
