= Getting Started

One of the best ways of getting started with a new platform is to try it out. Any big data platform has a lot of moving parts and getting some hands on keyboard time with it helps reinforce learning.

== About this guide

Firstly, let's cover whether this *Getting Started* guide is right for you. This is intended as a learning tool to discover more about Stackable, its deployment and architecture.

* If you want to build a production cluster then this is not for you. This tutorial is to familiarize you with the Stackable architecture and is not a guide for building robust clusters.
* This is intended for use in a private network or lab; it doesn't enable many security features such as authentication or encryption and should not be directly connected to the Internet. Be careful if you're deploying in the cloud as your instances may default to using public IPs.

== Overview

Stackable is based on Kubernetes and uses this as the control plane to manage clusters. In this guide we will build a simple cluster with 3 services; Apache ZooKeeper, Apache Kafka and Apache NiFi.

== Installing Kubernetes and kubectl

Stackable's control plane is built around Kubernetes. Follow the xref:kubernetes.adoc#local-installation[instructions] on how to set up a local Kubernetes instance if you do not have access to a cluster and install kubectl.

If you already have kubectl installed, and have access to a Kubernetes cluster, you can skip this step.

== Installing Stackable

=== Install stackablectl

Install the Stackable command line utility xref:management:stackablectl:index.adoc[stackablectl] by following the installation steps for your platform on the xref:management:stackablectl:installation.adoc[installation] page.

=== Installing Stackable Operators

The Stackable operators are components that translate the service definitions deployed via Kubernetes into deploy services on the worker nodes. These can be installed on any node that has access to the Kubernetes control plane. In this example we will install them on the controller node.

Stackable operators can be installed using `stackablectl`. Run the following commands to install ZooKeeper, Kafka and NiFi from the Stackable 23.7 release.

[source,bash]
----
stackablectl release install -i commons -i secret -i zookeeper -i kafka -i nifi 23.7
----

.Using Helm instead
[%collapsible]
====
NOTE: These examples assume Helm version 3. They will not work with Helm version 2.

Add the stackable-stable Helm Chart repository:

[source,bash]
----
helm repo add stackable-stable https://repo.stackable.tech/repository/helm-stable/
----

Install the operators:

[source,bash]
----
helm install zookeeper-operator stackable-stable/zookeeper-operator --version=23.7
helm install kafka-operator stackable-stable/kafka-operator --version=23.7
helm install secret-operator stackable-stable/secret-operator --version=23.7
helm install commons-operator stackable-stable/commons-operator --version=23.7
helm install nifi-operator stackable-stable/nifi-operator --version=23.7
----
====

You can check which operators are installed using `stackablectl operator installed`:

== Deploying Stackable Services

At this point you've successfully deployed Kubernetes and the Stackable operators we need and are ready to deploy services to the cluster. To do this we provide service descriptions to Kubernetes for each of the services we wish to deploy.

=== Apache ZooKeeper

We will deploy an Apache ZooKeeper instance to our cluster.

[source,bash]
----
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
---
apiVersion: zookeeper.stackable.tech/v1alpha1
kind: ZookeeperCluster
metadata:
  name: simple-zk
spec:
  image:
    productVersion: "3.8.1"
  clusterConfig:
    tls:
      serverSecretClass: null
  servers:
    roleGroups:
      primary:
        replicas: 1
        config:
          myidOffset: 10
---
apiVersion: zookeeper.stackable.tech/v1alpha1
kind: ZookeeperZnode
metadata:
  name: simple-zk-znode
spec:
  clusterRef:
    name: simple-zk
EOF
----

=== Apache Kafka

We will deploy an Apache Kafka broker that depends on the ZooKeeper service we just deployed. The zookeeperReference property below points to the namespace and name we gave to the ZooKeeper service deployed previously.

[source,bash]
----
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
---
apiVersion: kafka.stackable.tech/v1alpha1
kind: KafkaCluster
metadata:
  name: simple-kafka
spec:
  image:
    productVersion: "3.4.0"
  clusterConfig:
    zookeeperConfigMapName: simple-kafka-znode
    tls:
      serverSecretClass: null
  brokers:
    roleGroups:
      brokers:
        replicas: 1
---
apiVersion: zookeeper.stackable.tech/v1alpha1
kind: ZookeeperZnode
metadata:
  name: simple-kafka-znode
spec:
  clusterRef:
    name: simple-zk
    namespace: default
EOF
----

=== Apache NiFi

We will next deploy an Apache NiFi server.

[source,bash]
----
kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
---
apiVersion: zookeeper.stackable.tech/v1alpha1
kind: ZookeeperZnode
metadata:
  name: simple-nifi-znode
spec:
  clusterRef:
    name: simple-zk
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: nifi-admin-credentials-simple
stringData:
  username: admin
  password: AdminPassword
---
apiVersion: nifi.stackable.tech/v1alpha1
kind: NifiCluster
metadata:
  name: simple-nifi
spec:
  image:
    productVersion: "1.21.0"
  clusterConfig:
    listenerClass: external-unstable
    zookeeperConfigMapName: simple-nifi-znode
    authentication:
      method:
        singleUser:
          adminCredentialsSecret: nifi-admin-credentials-simple
    sensitiveProperties:
      keySecret: nifi-sensitive-property-key
      autoGenerate: true
  nodes:
    roleGroups:
      default:
        replicas: 1
EOF
----

You can check the status of the services using `kubectl get pods`. This will retrieve the status of all pods running in the default namespace.

----
NAME                                             READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE

simple-zk-server-primary-0                       1/1     Running     0          14m
zookeeper-operator-deployment-64fcccc797-pckhf   1/1     Running     0          14m
----

Since this is the first time that each of these services has been deployed to these nodes, it will take some time to download the software from the Stackable repository and deploy the services. Once all the pods are in the running state your cluster is ready to use.

== Testing your cluster

If all has gone well then you will have successfully deployed a Stackable cluster and used it to start three services that should now be ready for you.

=== Apache ZooKeeper

We can test ZooKeeper by running the ZooKeeper CLI shell. The easiest way to do this is to run the CLI shell on the pod that is running ZooKeeper.

[source,bash]
----
kubectl exec -i -t simple-zk-server-primary-0 -- bin/zkCli.sh
----

The shell should connect automatically to the ZooKeeper server running on the pod. You can run the `ls /` command to see the list of znodes in the root path, which should include those created by Apache Kafka and Apache NiFi.

----
[zk: localhost:2181(CONNECTED) 0] ls /
[znode-81484420-e097-4b13-a121-84f0211b99db, znode-9076785e-39d0-49cc-b067-30be25bf4faa, znode-a4b12f66-48c2-40dc-91d8-a42135eaf371, zookeeper]
----

=== Apache Kafka

To test Kafka we'll create a topic, and verify that it was created.
First create the topic with the following command:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl exec -i -t simple-kafka-broker-brokers-0 -c kafka -- \
  bin/kafka-topics.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --create --topic demo
----

You should see the message, "Created topic demo." on the console. Now let's check to see if it was actually created:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl exec -i -t simple-kafka-broker-brokers-0 -c kafka -- \
  bin/kafka-topics.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --list
----

=== Apache NiFi

Apache NiFi provides a web interface and the easiest way to test it is to view this in a web browser.
To access the web interface we first need to get the ip address and port Nifi is listening on.
To get the IP address we need to connect to (in this case `172.18.0.2`), run:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl get nodes -o wide
----
----
NAME                       STATUS   ROLES           AGE     VERSION   INTERNAL-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   OS-IMAGE             KERNEL-VERSION    CONTAINER-RUNTIME
quickstart-control-plane   Ready    control-plane   9m59s   v1.25.3   172.18.0.2    <none>        Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS   5.14.0-1052-oem   containerd://1.6.9
----


With the following command we get the port (in this case `31931`):

[source,bash]
----
kubectl get svc simple-nifi
----

----
NAME          TYPE       CLUSTER-IP    EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
simple-nifi   NodePort   10.96.82.80   <none>        8443:31931/TCP   7m51s
----

Browse to the address of your Kubernetes node on port `31931` e.g. https://172.18.0.2:31931/nifi and you should see the NiFi login screen.

image:nifi_login_screen.png[The Apache NiFi web interface login screen]

If a password has not been specified for the admin user the Apache NiFi operator will automatically generate the admin user credentials with a random password and store it as a Kubernetes secret in order to provide some security out of the box. In the example above we have provided our own secret, but you can retrieve and confirm this password for the `admin` user with the following kubectl command.

[source,bash]
----
kubectl get secrets nifi-admin-credentials-simple \
-o jsonpath="{.data.password}" | base64 -d && echo
----

Once you have these credentials you can log in and you should see a blank NiFi canvas.
